Hope you are resting comfortably. Please take this as an excuse to get much needed rest. Lots of
people have expressed best wishes for you to me--Sean Wilentz, Joe Conason, Gene Lyons, etc--so
if they haven't contacted you because you're behind a wall you should know that many, many people
are thinking about you now.
I spoke this morning to Gary Sick, who, you recall, was senior person on NSC during the Iran hostage
crisis, and is now at Columbia. He has one of the best intelligence networks on Iran, 1,500 people,
experts with extensive contacts, and many Iranians, deeply embedded in the unfolding events
Gary tells me that Mousavi has evolved from a mild-mannered
reformer to directly challenging the regime. Nobody, he says, knows where this will go, certainly not
the Iranians. Khamenei has exposed himself and lost his aura of mystification, plunging into the arena
as a political player. Mousavi has issued a new revolutionary manifesto, just translated; I enclose
below Sick's report and analysis on it. This poses, Sick says, a new challenge to Khamenei. Does he
let it stand? Does he answer it? Sick also says US diplomacy in fact can't accomplish anything with
the regime until the crisis completely works its way out, which could take years. He points out that the
first mass demonstrations against the Shah occurred a full year before his overthrow. He adds that
the one thing the regime has learned fro m the Shah is not to be equivocal toward demonstrations.
Two ideas, who knows, but here they are: 1. Though the regime uses Western protests to consolidate
control, some of them contribute to its deep crisis of legitimacy. Sick says Obama's statement, for
example, was good. He also cites a statement from Ban Ki Moon. If there would be a UN action,
shouldn't it focus ont he human rights/violence aspect? A statement and/or resolution urging the
regime to stop illegitimate violence of paramilitary militias? US shouldn't initiate. 2. Establish linkage
in negotiations with Russians on Start between their objections to missile defense outposts in Poland
and Czech Republic (especially if we plan to give them up) with Russian arms sales to Iran.
Get well. See Sick analysis below.

5ousavi's New Revolutionary Manifesto
by Gary Sick
June 21, 2009 I 10:51am
—
L Alfred, Sipa / AP Photo The Iranian protest movement reached a tipping point today, writes Gary Sick,
•
the key White House offical during the 1979 hostage crisis, and what has emerged is nothing short of a platform for
a true Islamic democracy.
Plus, read more insight on Iran's election from other Daily Beast writers.
Today, Mir Hossein Mousavi, the presidential candidate who has come to represent the democratic aspirations
of the Iranian people, issued a formal statement.
Although he denounces the ""lies and fraud"" of the leadership, particularly in the recent election, he views the
fraudulent election as only as the symptom of something far more serious. He describes a revolution gone
wrong, a revolution that was originally based on attention to the voice of the peo ple but has resulted in ""forcing
an unwanted government on the nation.""
It is apparent from this statement that Mousavi's movement—and Mousavi himself—have evolved enormously
in the past week.
This moment is ""a turning point,"" he says, and he defines the movement that is forming around him as having a
""historical mission"" to accomplish nothing less than ""renewing the life of the nation"" according to its own
ideals.
He acknowledges, interestingly, that his own voice at the beginning was less ""eloquent"" than he would have
wished and that the people were ahead of him in turning the movement green. But now he accepts the ""burden
of duty put on our shoulders by the destiny of generations and ages.""
He denounces both extremes of the political spectrum: on one hand those who believe that ""Islamic government
is the same as Tyranny of the Rightful;"" and on the other, those who ""consider religion and Islam to be blockers
for realization of republicanism,"" i.e. those who believe that democracy is incompatible with Islam.
Mousavi says his call for annulment of the election and a revote, supervised by an impartial national body, ""is a
given right."" The objective is nothing less than ""to achieve a new type of political life in the country.""
That is truly a revolutionary statement. He says he will stand by the side of all those seeking ""new solutions"" in
a n on-violent way. He accepts the principles and the institutions of the Islamic Republic, including the
Revolutionary Guard and the basij, but denounces ""deviations and deceptions."" He demands reform ""that
returns us to the pure principles of the Islamic Revolution.""
He calls for freedom of expression in all its forms, and says that if the government permits people to express
their views freely, ""there won't be a need for the presence of military and regulatory forces in the streets.""
It is apparent from this statement that Mousavi's movement—and Mousavi himself—have evolved enormously
in the past week. The candidate started as a mild-mannered reformer. After the searing events of the past several
days, he has dared to preach a counter sermon to Khamene'i's lecture on Islamic government. Although he never
mentions the Leader by name, there is no overlooking the direct contradiction of his arguments. This open
opposition to the Leader by a political figure is unprecedented. •
Mousavi has in fact issued a manifesto for a new vision of the Islamic Republic. The repression and disdain of
the government has brought the opposition to a place they probably never dreamed of going. And no one knows
where any of the parties are likely to go next.
But for outside observers, it is like standing on the edge of a glacier and feeling the ice begin to crack under
your feet.
Gary Sick served on the National Security Council staff under Presidents Ford, Carter and Reagan. He was the
principal White House aide for Iran during the Iranian Revolution and the hostage crisis and is the author of
two books on U.S.-Iranian relations. Mr. Sick is a captain (ret.) in the US. Navy, with service in the Persian
Gulf North Africa and the Mediterranean. He was the deputy director for International Affairs at the Ford
Foundation from 1982 to 1987, where he was responsible for programs relating to US. foreign policy. Mr. Sick
has a Ph.D. in political science from Columbia University, where he is Senior Research Scholar, adjunct
professor of international affairs and former director of the Middle East Institute (2000-2003). He is the
executive director of Gulf/2000, an international research project on political, economic and security
developments in the Persian Gulf being conducted at Columbia University with support from a number of
major foundations. He is co-editor offour books on the Persian Gulf published by the Gulf/2000 project and
Palgrave (formerly St Martin's) Press in New York. Mr. Sick is a member (emeritus) of the board of Human
Rights Watch in New York and founding chairman of its Middle East and North Africa advisory committee.

RELEASE IN FULL
S.840 - International Clean Energy Development Act of 2009
Bill Highlights
The International Clean Energy Development Act of 2009, directs the U.S. Asia-Pacific
Partnership (APP) Program Office of the U.S. Department of State to establish a Development
and Commercialization Committee on Clean and Efficient Energy Technologies. The committee
shall review all existing APP action plans that focus on technology advancement, including
cleaner fossil fuel and power generation, determine the projects that should be expedited and
then leverage existing financial mechanisms to fund them. The bill authorizes funding of $200
million annually from 2010 to 2015. The new committee enables the APP to strengthen its focus
on development and commercialization of clean energy technologies — as well as:
• Engages specific countries with the largest markets, manufacturing bases, and
distribution chains in order to leverage their assets to achieve lower technology
development and commercialization costs and influence global standards.
• Receives a minimum of 100% match in funding. Existing APP Program Office policy
requires all projects to have a minimum 1 for 1 match for funding from partners —
equaling a program total of $2 billion in 5 years, contingent on U.S. funding at $200
million per year.
• Strengthens U.S. International Climate Diplomacy efforts by strengthening existing
channels of engagement with critical countries (China and India) in areas where they can
effectively contribute to the global effort of reducing GHG emissions.
APP Background
Initiated in July of 2005, The Asia-Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate (APP)
brings together seven major Asia-Pacific countries — Australia, Canada, China, India, Japan,
Korea, and the United States — that collectively account for more than half of the world's
economy, population, and energy use. Within this framework; the Partners are cooperating in
voluntary and collaborative efforts to address increased energy needs and the associated issues of
air pollution, energy security, and climate change. An innovative public-private sector effort, the
Asia-Pacific Partnership was established to achieve these objectives in ways that promote
economic development, reduce poverty, and accelerate the development and deployment of
cleaner, more efficient technologies. The work of the Asia-Pacific Partnership comprises a wide
range of activities. The initial portfolio of Partnership projects is weighted toward activities such
best practice identification, and technology research and demonstration, with project examples
including: standardized energy efficient lighting; transforming waste to fuel in cement kilns;
improving carbon capture technology for coal-fired power plants; developing coal mining health
and safety strategies; sharing best practices in power generation; promoting solar power
deployment; and increasing usage of cleaner steel technologies.

U.N. asks Afghanistan to lift election media ban
KABUL, Aug 19 (Reuters) - The United Nations has asked Afghanistan to lift a last-minute ban on media reporting of
violence during Thursday's presidential election, saying the Afghan constitution guaranteed a free press. Afghan
authorities imposed the ban on Tuesday with two decrees, the first barring journalists from reporting any violence in the
country between 6:00 a.m. and 8:00 p.m. (0130-1530 GMT) on polling day. The second ordered journalists to stay away
from the scenes of any attacks. The government says the measures are intended to prevent reports of violence from
scaring Afghans away from voting. Taliban fighters have vowed to disrupt the election. The United Nations said Afghans
had a right to information, and restricting the media could undermine confidence in the poll. ""People need access to
information, not only on polling day but after polling day. The credibility of these elections is directly linked to the
information that they have access to,"" said Aleem Siddique, spokesman for the U.N. mission in Kabul. ""Its unclear to us
what if any legal basis there would be for such a directive when Afghanistan's constitution guarantees freedom of
expression and freedom of the press. We are making this point to the Afghan authorities,"" he said on
Wednesday. Afghan police have taken a more aggressive attitude towards reporters in recent days. Several journalists
were beaten by police at the scene of a suicide car bombing on Tuesday and a siege with gunmen on Wednesday.

The Uncommon Trustee
FROM ETHIOPIA TO L.A. WITH $150 IN HIS POCKET,
DANIEL YOHANNES BRINGS A
QUIET DETERMINATION TO HIS TRUSTEE ROLE.
By Leah Arroyo
This article was published in Museum, July/August 2008.
Trustee. The word brings to mind a venerable patrician of senior years, ""trusted"" to guide the interests of an organization or
individual with wisdom and perspective. Someone with old-boy or -girl connections, decades of expertise and, especially, big bucks—
not to mention the ability to pry others away from theirs. Ascot not required, but it couldn't hurt.
In certain ways, Daniel Yohannes of Denver is not your typical museum trustee. At 17, with $150, he moved from Ethiopia to Los
Angeles as an exchange student without knowing a soul. He immediately got a part-time job as a stock boy in a clothing store and
went on to support himself through high school, Claremont McKenna College and the MBA program at Pepperdine. He began his
banking career as a teller at Security Pacific Bank.
But in other ways, Yohannes is the very portrait of a board member. At 55, the president and CEO of M&R Investments, a firm
specializing in real estate, financial institutions and energy. A former vice chairman of U.S. Bancorp. A few years ago he started a
bank in San Francisco on the side. His board membership extends from the financial (a Fortune 100 company) and educational (U.C.
Denver Business School) to community organizations (the chamber of commerce, the National Jewish Hospital and Research Center,
the Boy Scouts Council)—not to mention political service (chairing the transition team of Gov. Bill Ritter, Democrat of Colorado).
And museums, a priority among the board invitations he has accepted. He served on the Smithsonian Institution's national board for
six years and is now a trustee of the Denver Art Museum (DAM), where he established the Daniel Yohannes Family African Gallery. ""I
get a lot of my inspirations intellectually and culturally through art and history, primarily through museums,"" he says. ""So when I
was asked to sit on the [DAM] board, it was just a natural fit for me.""
For all his success, though, Yohannes hardly gives the impression of a Type-A personality. Courtly, soft-spoken, with a melodious
accent paying homage to his Ethiopian roots despite his decades in the U.S., he is generous and unhurried with his time in
interviews. On the phone, he asks how you are, what you've been up to lately; told that an interviewer just bought her first house,
he chats for a few moments about how delightful and meaningful that purchase is. In person, for a conversation at the AAM Annual
Meeting in Denver last spring, he walked into a rather dreary underground room in the convention center, suave in a conservative
navy suit and warm in his greetings, politely oblivious to the tables cluttered with the conference staff's walkie-talkies, office supplies
and assortment of snacks. The photographer got sent to the wrong room and his interviewer had to scurry the length of several
football fields to find her? No problem; he'd reserved plenty of time to talk. ""Take your time.""
And yet you can at times glimpse the calm determination of a man who gets things done and, moreover, fiAly expects to. Vicki
Sterling, the Denver Art Museum's assistant director, says that ""what was truly unique about working with [Yohannes] on the African
gallery was his ability to bring together people from outside the regular museum donor community and get them interested in the
Denver Art Museum."" When you ask him how he did this, who these new museophiles were, you can almost hear him shrug over the
phone. ""Friends of mine, people I knew,"" he says. ""They contributed because I asked them to."" He also shrugs off the question of
how he fits all his commitments into his schedule: ""I think as long as there's a desire to get everything done, it gets done."" Asked
what he does for fun, he has to think for a moment. ""That's a good one. . . . I walk, I play a little golf, do a little bicycling,
sightseeing."" He also collects art, particularly African works, inspired years ago by his travels, though ""only as a hobby."" Last but not
least, he cherishes spending time with his three children, two of whom live in the area, and was overjoyed to become a grandfather
in May (""She's beautiful,"" he beams).

You walk away from him with an impression of a quietly dynamic man who has more priorities than most of us but can somehow
bring extraordinary focus to each in turn. He says he was driven from the very beginning. ""It was my decision to come here, not my
family's. I've always been a very adventurous person, ever since I was a child, so I made a decision early on that I wanted to make
it on my own. I wanted to go to a place that provided that opportunity for someone like myself, an immigrant. I could not find any
other place but here in the United States that provided all of that opportunity."" Perhaps later generations of his family will be more
jaded about the American dream, but Yohannes speaks of it with unembarrassed directness. ""For someone like myself, it's much
easier to give to the community that has given you so much.""
Fortunately, he sees museum leadership as part of that obligation.

They are now saying that Zelaya doesn't want to travel tomorrow because wants to participate (remotely) in the burial
ceremony on Monday for those who died in violence at the airport today. He said he will return to Washington on
Tuesday in time to meet in the late afternoon. They are asking if it would be possible to have the meeting sometime on
Tuesday late afternoon instead.

Huma and Lona,
Sorry for the late email, but Central America Office Director Christopher Webster just called me to inquire about a
possible meeting between Zelaya and the Secretary tomorrow. He said they are trying to convince Zelaya to return from
San Salvador to the U.S. and that A/S Shannon indicated the Secretary had said that she would be willing to meet with
him tomorrow. They were wondering if they could give Zelaya a window of time for a meeting (see email below from
DCM in Sal Salvador). Please advise.

At 1945, local NIC media aired footage from MGA airport of Zelaya getting back on plane. It appeared that FM Rodas
and Ven FM Maduro were also in departing party.

NIC president Ortega put Z on plane at airport, but did not go with him.
Footage was recent, if not live, perhaps no more than 20 minutes old.

Looping other members of SITREP spam -- Managua understands that plane with ousted HOND President Zelaya left
WDC at approx 1500 WDC time. Also understand that plane is expected in Managua at approx 1924 local. Understand
that a separate plane with Argentine Pres Kirchner and Ecuadorian Pres. Correa also left WDC this afternoon en route to
El Salvador.
NEW INFORMATION
About 45 minutes ago, Telesur had images of apparent pro-Zelaya supporters at the airport fence and trying to pull it
down. Security forces inside the airport compound re-deployed to prevent a breach. It seems they did use white smoke
or gas to deter protestor action. Telesur also reported that shots were fired into the assembled crowd and that one or
two people were shot and killed (no names or confirmation). Images of ambulances in crowd were visible.
It seems now that the fence has been breached and a handful of pro-Zelaya supporters move in and out of airport area
to pick up rocks and retreat (there is open, clear area inside fence, possible construction). Security forces have taken up
positions on tarmac, presumably to prevent further incursion.
With respect to Micheleti assertion that NIC troops have mobilized near the border, our NIC contacts, both in GON and
private citizens indicate that there has been NO/NO unusual NIC mil activity at border -- Las Manos or El Espino.
However, as of 1900 Saturday, border contacts at El Espino report that HOND military reinforced its presence by about
70 personnel, who remain at El Espino. We were told this happened at Las Manos as well, but have not yet been able to
confirm with our sources at that border location.
Will continue to monitor and observe.

Greg Sargent's blog
Hillary Consulted Republicans, Neocons, And Liberals For Big
Foreign Policy Speech
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has consulted with a surprisingly diverse ideological bunch in the course of
creating the major foreign policy speech she plans to deliver tomorrow, including Republicans like Henry
Kissinger, Brent Scowcroft and George Schultz, and onetime neocons like Francis Fukuyama, a source familiar
with the speech-writing process tells me.
Hillary is set to deliver her high-profile speech at the Council on Foreign Relations, and is set to articulate her
own policy agenda, one focused on strengthening America's ""smart power,"" according to The Politico. It could
help settle whether she has privately favored a more hawkish stance towards hostile foreign powers, as she
reportedly has.
The array of people she has consulted for this speech is striking in its diversity, boasting a notable array of
Republicans, foreign policy ""realists"" and hawkish voices. A partial list:
Henry Kissinger, Nixon's secretary of state; George Schultz, Reagan's secretary of state; Zbigniew
Brzezinski, Jimmy Carter's hawkish ""realist"" foreign policy adviser; Paul Farmer, a doctor and international
humanitarian; Joseph Nye, a major proponent of ""soft power,"" the idea that persuasion and attraction can be
more effective than coercion; Francis Fukuyama, who helped drive the rise of neoconservatism; Brent
Scowcroft; the ""realist"" national security adviser under George H.W. Bush; Strobe Talbott, Clinton's deputy
secretary of state; John Podesta, the head of the liberal Center for American Progress; and Richard Lugar, the
Republican Senator who has praised Obama's response to the Iran crisis.
Hillary has also consulted with administration figures like President Obama himself, Defense Secretary Robert
Gates, and national security adviser James Jones.

Obviously there's someone here for everyone, and someone here for everyone to dislike, too. The array of
people she consulted strongly suggests that she views the speech as an extremely important moment for both the
Obama administration — and for her own tenure.

I believe the conversations were very important and productive, and more importantly, so do the survivors with whom you
spoke.
We look forward to working together this week and thereafter.
Sam .
Dear Secretary Clinton:
With reference to our letter dated June 19, 2009, on behalf of the Holocaust Survivors Foundation USA, Inc.
(HSF), I would like to state that based on conversations that took place in the intervening time period between
Ambassador Eizenstat and the leadership of the HSF, and the commitments he made to our leaders, we are no longer
asking that he be replaced as the head of the U.S. delegation to the Prague Conference taking place on June 26-30.
On behalf of all of the survivors for whom we have been fighting over the last decade, including tens of thousands
in desperate need, we wish Ambassador Eizenstat the best of success as the head of the United States delegation at the
Conference, as well as in the follow-up activities that we understand will occur on matters affecting Holocaust survivors'
rights and interests.
Sincerely,
David Schaecter

U.N. asks Afghanistan to lift election media ban
KABUL, Aug 19 (Reuters) - The United Nations has asked Afghanistan to lift a last-minute ban on media reporting of
violence during Thursday's presidential election, saying the Afghan constitution guaranteed a free press. Afghan
authorities imposed the ban on Tuesday with two decrees, the first barring journalists from reporting any violence in the
country between 6:00 a.m. and 8:00 p.m. (0130-1530 GMT) on polling day. The second ordered journalists to stay away
from the scenes of any attacks. The government says the measures are intended to prevent reports of violence from
scaring Afghans away from voting. Taliban fighters have vowed to disrupt the election. The United Nations said Afghans
had a right to information, and restricting the media could undermine confidence in the poll. ""People need access to
information, not only on polling day but after polling day. The credibility of these elections is directly linked to the
information that they have access to,"" said Aleem Siddique, spokesman for the U.N. mission in Kabul. ""Its unclear to us
what if any legal basis there would be for such a directive when Afghanistan's constitution guarantees freedom of
expression and freedom of the press. We are making this point to the Afghan authorities,"" he said on Wednesday.
Afghan police have taken a more aggressive attitude towards reporters in recent days. Several journalists were beaten
by police at the scene of a suicide car bombing on Tuesday and a siege with gunmen on Wednesday.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton will soon announce that gay American diplomats will be
given benefits similar to those that their heterosexual counterparts enjoy, U.S. officials said Saturday.
In a notice to be sent soon to State Department employees, Clinton says regulations that denied same-sex couples and
their families the same rights and privileges that straight diplomats enjoyed are ""unfair and must end,"" as they harm U.S.
diplomacy.
""Providing training, medical care and other benefits to domestic partners promote the cohesiveness, safety and
effectiveness of our posts abroad,"" she says in the message, a copy of which was obtained by The Associated Press.
""It will also help the department attract and retain personnel in a competitive environment where domestic partner
benefits and allowances are increasingly the norm for world-class employers,"" she says.
""At bottom, the department will provide these benefits for both opposite-sex and same-sex domestic partners because
it is the right thing to do,"" Clinton says.
Among the benefits that will now be granted gay diplomats: the right of domestic partners to hold diplomatic passports,
government-paid travel for their partners and families to and from foreign posts, and the use of U.S. medical facilities
abroad.
In addition, gay diplomats' families will now be eligible for U.S. government emergency evacuations and training courses
at the Foreign Service Institute, the message says.
The announcement, expected this week, was provided to the AP by a State Department official who is a member of the
Gays and Lesbians in Foreign Affairs Agencies organization. Two department officials not affiliated with the organization
confirmed its accuracy.
The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publically about the changes.","UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05761689 Date: 06/30/2015

I'm being told -- and still trying to verify -- that as of last week, we've succumbed to the Europeans'

This is the first I've heard of this, but I will track it down.

Twitter delays down time to aid Iranian protesters
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department contacted the social networking service Twitter over
the weekend to urge it to delay a planned upgrade that could have cut daytime service to Iranians, a U.S.
official said on Tuesday.
""We highlighted to them that this was an important form of communication,"" said the official of the
conversation the department had with Twitter at the time of the disputed Iranian election. He declined
further details.

Dear Nora,
Please pass along the following message to Cheryl.
Thanks,
Jeff Sachs
Dear Cheryl,
Congratulations on the launch of the $20b G8 initiative. This will stand as a historic success of President Obama and
Secretary Clinton. Please do convey my personal congratulations and gratitude to Secretary Clinton if you have a
moment to do so. I know what a key role you personally played in bringing this to fruition.
I would like to suggest one overarching strategy for success.
Please do push hard on the donors (USAID included!) to pool the donor resources into one, at most two, multilateral
funding streams. Certainly the World Bank should be the main spigot, and IFAD possibly a second. By pooling the
resources, we'll cut down BY YEARS on the delays, donor negotiations, further talk, report writing, expert trips, etc., etc.,
which are now the biggest single threat to success of the initiative.
I look forward to a few minutes by phone or in person to offer some tips coming from long years of experience in this
sphere. This can be a real historic path-breaker, if it's not swallowed in the agencies!
Warm regards and kudos!
Jeff Sachs

pick for Protocol Post Corrects Failure to File Taxes in 2
Years
By ALISON LEIGH COWAN
The New York Times
June 19,2009
President Obama's choice as chief of protocol for the State Department, a position that carries the
status of an ambassadorship, did not file tax returns for 2005 and 2006, errors she corrected last
November.
The nominee, Capricia Penavic Marshall, has placed blame for the problem on the Postal Service and
on miscommunication between her husband and their accountant.
Ms. Marshall, who was a social secretary in the Clinton White House, notified the Obama
administration about the late filings before she was nominated on May 14. She has since provided
written answers to questions about the matter from Senator Richard G. Lugar of Indiana, the top
Republican on the Foreign Relations Committee, which will hold a hearing on the appointment next
Wednesday. The post requires Senate confirmation.
Tax issues have bedeviled several high-level Obama appointees and cost the administration at least
two of its picks.

Ms. Marshall, a graduate of Case Western Reserve University School of Law, may fare better because,
after ultimately filing the 2005 and 2006 federal and local paperwork, she was entitled to $37,259 in
refunds, according to information she provided to Mr. Lugar.
The nominee and her husband, Dr. Robert Marshall, a Washington cardiologist, did not return calls
seeking comment, nor did a White House spokesman.
Besides the president's support, Ms. Marshall appears to enjoy the strong endorsement of Secretary of
State Hillary Rodham Clinton and former President Bill Clinton. Ms. Marshall worked on their
campaigns and was most recently executive director of Mrs. Clinton's political action committee,
Hillpac.
In her written answers and in accounts she gave to government officials, Ms. Marshall has said the
errors were inadvertent. She has said that her husband failed to recognize that the couple's
accountant had included the tax returns for 2005 in a binder he provided with copies of the returns,
and that the actual paperwork was never mailed.
The couple learned something was awry, Ms. Marshall has said, when the Internal Revenue Service
notified them last fall that their 2006 return had never arrived. She wrote that an agent ""advised us
that there were a large number of tax returns misplaced by the D.C. post office for the 2006 tax year.""
That call led the couple to the discovery that the authorities had no record of their returns for 2005
and 2006. No late fees or penalties were assessed when they later submitted the returns.
The protocol chief customarily helps plan events for visiting leaders and helps oversee protocol
matters for the president and vice president abroad.

Preaching reform, Clinton wins African hearts
By DONNA BRYSON (AP) –1 hour ago
JOHANNESBURG — In Liberia, Hillary Clinton brought out the crowds despite torrential rain. In Congo, she came away
deeply shaken from a meeting with rape victims. Kenya's prime minister said Africa didn't need lectures from the West
about democracy, but Africa got one anyway.
At home, the U.S. secretary of state's visit may have been overshadowed by the aftermath of her husband's mission to
North Korea to bring home two imprisoned U.S. journalists. But on her seven-nation Africa tour, ending Friday with a
stopover in the West African island republic of Cape Verde, she made one splash after another.
Coupled with Barack Obama's visit last month, the two trips to Africa were the earliest into an administration by any
secretary of state or president, underlining Washington's pledges to pay more attention to the continent.

In the U.S., the headline-making moment of the trip was her testy response to a question about Bill Clinton. But in
Africa, it quickly became a footnote. What people wanted to hear was support for democracy, clean government and
ending its many civil wars.
Clinton's ambitious itinerary resembled those of China's foreign minister, who makes extensive annual tours of his
country's allies on the continent. But where China tends to sidestep the issues of corruption democracy, Clinton
confronted them head-on.
Kenyan Prime Minister Raila Odinga, speaking hours before Clinton arrived, said Africa did not need to be lectured about
democracy. After they met, she did just that. ""The absence of strong and effective democratic institutions has permitted
ongoing corruption, impunity, politically motivated violence and a lack of respect for a rule of law,"" Clinton said. ""These
conditions ... are continuing to hold Kenya back.""
Odinga switched to a more conciliatory tone, saying African countries could learn from Clinton's example when she
conceded defeat to Obama during the U.S. presidential primaries.
""That is a lesson Africa needs to learn seriously,"" he said. ""In Africa, in many countries, elections are never won, they are
only rigged. The losers never accept that they lost. If we do this, we will be able to develop democracy truly in the
African continent.""
In Angola, she told Foreign Minister Assuncao Afonso dos Anjos that his country needed to write a new constitution,
prosecute human rights crimes and hold a proper presidential election.
""So, Mr. Minister, we have our work cut out for us,"" she said.
And in Nigeria, Africa's biggest oil producer, she said ""the disconnect between Nigeria's wealth and its poverty is a
failure of governance at the federal, state and local level.""
To Africa's reformers, often an embattled minority, these were heartening words.
Emma Ezeazu, who campaigns for free and fair elections in his native Nigeria, said Clinton's visit showed that U.S.
officials ""are becoming more pro-active in their relationship with Nigeria, in particular on the subject of governance and
democracy. They are paying more attention.""
Tiseke Kasambala, a Johannesburg-based researcher for Human Rights Watch, commended her grasp of human rights
abuses in Africa — not just the headline-makers, like Zimbabwe and Congo, but the lesser publicized offenders such as
Angola.
In Goma, a Congo town in a region ravaged by gang rapes amid continuing fighting between army and rebels, Clinton
announced $17 million in American aid to help the victims.
She toured a squalid camp of 18,000 refugees and heard one of them tell her, ""We really want to return home, that's
why we are asking America to help stop the fighting.""
""That's why I'm here,"" Clinton replied. ""I want you to be able to go home.""
In Cape Town, South Africa, big, joyous crowds turned out for her at a housing project. In Liberia, founded in 1847 by
freed American slaves, rain-drenched crowds waved U.S. and Liberian flags at Clinton's motorcade.
The crowds in Nigeria and Angola were fewer, but community and religious leaders seemed excited just to be with
Clinton and be heard by her.

Nancy Kachingwe, a Malawian with the development group ActionAid, applauded Clinton's ""very strong emphasis
around women's rights.""
Some of former President George W. Bush's Africa initiatives, particularly on AIDS, have been widely praised in Africa.
But there were also sharp differences over world trade, global warming, and over the Bush administration's anti-
terrorism strategy.
Washington wants to buy Africa's oil and gain access to its markets, and fears instability in places like Somalia could fuel
anti-U.S. terrorism. Clinton won points by stressing that as the U.S. pursues its interests, it sees the virtue of ""working
with and listening to our friends and allies, and creating not a multipolar world, but a multi-partner world.""
Kachingwe said what matters now is the follow-up.
""There will be a positive impact"" from Clinton's trip, she said. ""But somewhere along the way, we do need to see ...
what's going to come to keep the momentum going.""

North Korea frees detained South Korea worker
By KWANG-TAE KIM (AP) – 2 hours ago
SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea has freed a South Korean worker detained for months in the communist country,
officials said Thursday, brightening prospects for improved relations on the peninsula.
The release came days after Hyundai Group Chairwoman Hyun Jung-eun traveled to Pyongyang in an effort to secure the
employee's freedom, and a week after the isolated regime freed two U.S. journalists sentenced to 12 years of hard labor
for entering the North illegally in March. That release followed a surprise visit by former President Bill Clinton, who held
talks with North Korean leader Kim Jong II.
The 44-year-old technician, surnamed Yoo, worked at an industrial zone in the North's border city of Kaesong, where
about 110 South Korean-run factories employ about 40,000 North Korean workers. He was detained in March for
allegedly denouncing the North's political system.
Though one of the few joint projects still running, the complex's viability has come under questions in recent months as
the North refused to release Yoo and demanded a massive increase in payments and recent at the industrial park. It now
has only a skeletal South Korean staff.
Unification Ministry spokeswoman Lee Jong-joo said Yoo — an employee of the Hyundai Group's North Korean business
arm, Hyundai Asan — had been released and was expected to return to South Korea later Thursday.
""It's fortunate that Yoo is returning to his family, though it's rather late,"" presidential spokesman Lee Dong-kwan said in
a statement. He added that the South Korean government will maintain a ""consistent policy"" toward North Korea.

Lee did not elaborate, but South Korean President Lee Myung-bak's government has taken a hard-line approach toward
North Korea, and the North responded by cutting off most ties and halting or curtailing key joint projects except for the
Kaesong complex.
A council made up of South Korean companies operating in Kaesong welcomed Yoo's release and expressed hope it
would ""improve frozen South-North relations and revitalize"" the troubled complex.
The North, however, is still holding four South Korean fishermen whose boat was seized last month after straying
accidentally into northern waters. North Korea told the South earlier Thursday that its investigation into the case is still
continuing, Unification Ministry spokesman Chun Hae-sung told reporters. No details were given.
Ahead of the news of Yoo's release Thursday, about 100 demonstrators gathered in central Seoul to demand the release
of the detained worker and the fishermen. Some burned a North Korean flag and photos of Kim.
Hyundai has poured hundreds of millions of dollars into the industrial zone and a joint tourist project promoted by more
liberal South Korean governments in the past. But renewed tension between the rivals has seen a suspension of trips to
the North by South Korean tourists and a dramatic reduction in the number of South Koreans working in the industrial
zone.
The two Koreas technically remain at war since the 1950-53 Korean conflict ended in a cease-fire, not a peace treaty.
Associated Press writer Hyung-jin Kim contributed to this report.

Obama envoy: Time to act on climate change By ARTHUR MAX –2 hours ago
BONN, Germany (AP) — Once booed at international climate talks, the United States won sustained applause Sunday
when President Barack Obama's envoy pledged to ""make up for lost time"" in reaching a global agreement on climate
change.
Todd Stern also praised efforts by countries like China to reign in their carbon emissions, but said global warming
""requires a global response"" and that rapidly developing economies like China ""must join together"" with the industrial
world to solve the problem.
The debut of Obama's climate change team was widely anticipated after eight years of obdurate participation in U.N.
climate talks by the previous Bush administration.
""We are very glad to be back. We want to make up for lost time, and we are seized with the urgency of the task before
us,"" Stern said to loud applause from the 2,600 delegates to the U.N. negotiations.
They clapped again when Stern said the U.S. recognized ""our unique responsibility ... as the largest historic emitter of
greenhouse gases,"" which has created a problem threatening the entire world.
The two-week meeting by 175 countries that began Sunday was the latest stage of talks aimed at forging a climate
change agreement to replace the 1997 Kyoto Protocol on emissions targets for rich countries, which expires in 2012.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05761448 Date: 06/30/2015
The United States was instrumental in negotiating Kyoto, but failed to win support at home. When George W. Bush took
office, he renounced it, calling Kyoto a flawed agreement that would harm the U.S. economy and unfair because it
demanded nothing from countries like China or India.
Stern said his team did not want a repeat of the Kyoto debacle. The latest agreement is due to be finalized in December
in Copenhagen, Denmark.
""Ultimately, this is a political process,"" he said. ""The way forward is steered by science and pragmatism.""
Stern said no one on his team doubted that climate change is real. ""The science is clear, the threat is real, the facts on
the ground are outstripping the worst-case scenarios. The cost of inaction or inadequate action are unacceptable,"" he
said — a total change of tone from his predecessors.
Scientists warned recently that climate change is happening more rapidly that previously calculated and said the Earth
could be in danger of major climatic changes that would trigger widespread social disruption. U.N. scientists say rising
sea levels caused by global warming threatens to swamp coastlines and entire island states, and predicted increasing
drought for arid countries, especially in Africa.
Obama has set aside $80 billion in his economic stimulus package for green energy, promised $150 billion for research
over 10 years, and was tightening regulations on auto emissions, Stern said.
""America itself cannot provide the solution, but there is no solution without America,"" he said.
""It sent chills up my spine seeing the U.S. applauded,"" Keya Chatterjee of the Worldwide Fund for Nature said after
Stern's speech.
It was only 15 months ago at Bali, Indonesia, that U.S. negotiators were booed when they threatened to veto an accord
laying down a two-year negotiating process to replace Kyoto. They backed off when the delegate from Papua New
Guinea, Kevin Conrad, told them if ""you are not willing to lead ... please get out of the way.""
Stern urged delegates Sunday to adopt a long-range vision for reducing climate change, rather than to focus on ""a series
of short-term, stopgap measures,"" and repeated Obama's determination to cut emissions by 80 percent by mid-century.
His speech was meant to shift the debate from persistent demands by developing countries for industrial nations to
reduce emissions by 25-40 percent below 1990 levels by 2020. Stern has said previously that goal was unattainable for
the U.S.
Speaking earlier to reporters, Stern defended the U.S. administration's goal of reducing U.S. carbon emissions by roughly
16 percent over the next dozen years from current levels.
""We don't think (the target) is low at all,"" he said, adding it was ""consistent with what other countries are willing to do.""
Others disagreed.
""The target that the United States has put forward is not going to be sufficient,"" said Chatterjee.
Jake Schmidt of the Nature Resources Defense Council said the Obama administration was talking behind the scenes
about setting an annual emissions reduction target leading up to 2050.
""It's hard to turn a big ship around, but it would show we are serious about our commitments to cut emissions from the
medium to the long term,"" Schmidt said.

With time running out before the pact is due to be completed in December, delegates are trying to narrow vast
differences over how best to fight climate change.
Issues include how much countries need to reduce emissions, how to raise the tens of billions of dollars needed annually
to fight global warming and how to transfer money and technology to poor countries who are most vulnerable to
increasingly fierce storms, droughts and failing crops.
Stern said the U.S. position will be guided by whatever deal Obama can strike with Congress.
""I do not think that it is realistic to believe that we will then be able to go into an international setting and get a higher
number than that,"" he said.

US to push for UN climate deal but no ""magic wand""

* Obama to push for new climate treaty
* Climate envoy says no magic wand, sets limits to U.S. cuts
(Adds details, quotes)
By Alister Doyle, Environment Correspondent
BONN, Germany, March 29 (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama's administration promised to push for a new global
treaty to fight global warming at United Nations climate talks on Sunday but cautioned it had no magic wand.
""The United States is going to be powerfully and fully engaged,"" U.S. special envoy for climate change Todd Stern said at
the opening of 175-nation U.N. talks in Bonn.
""But we are all going to have to do this together, we don't have a magic wand,"" he told a news conference at the March
29-April 8 meeting in Bonn, the first since Obama took office. The U.S. delegation was greeted by applause at the
opening.
Stern said the United States wanted to work for a treaty that was economically ""doable"" and that countries could not
expect Washington to ""ride in on a white horse"" to solve the problem. ""We can't,"" he said.
Some nations, racked by recession, have been waiting to hear Obama's policies before unveiling their own. The Bonn
talks are due to consider issues including the levels of greenhouse gas cuts needed to slow global warming.
Obama has promised to cut U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by about 16-17 percent from current levels to take them
back to 1990 levels by 2020 as part of a new U.N. climate deal meant to be agreed in Copenhagen in December.
Under former President George W. Bush, the United States was isolated among industrialised nations in opposing caps
on emissions under the U.N.'s existing Kyoto Protocol. Delegates even booed U.S. delegates at a meeting in Indonesia, in
2007.

""Everyone is very excited"" by signs of a stronger U.S. commitment, Yvo de Boer, head of the U.N. Climate Change
Secretariat, told a news conference. China and the United States are the top greenhouse gas emitters.
NO WHITE HORSE
Stern said, however, that the United States could not make the deepest cuts in greenhouse gases advised by the U.N.
Climate Panel for 2020 to avoid the worst of global warming, of between 25 and 40 percent below 1990 levels.
""We should be guided by a combination of science and Pragmatism,"" Stern said. Many developing nations, led by China,
want rich nations to make deep cuts.
Almost no developed nations have laid out goals within the 25-40 percent range. Among the most ambitious, the
European Union plans cuts of 20 percent below 1990 levels by 2020.
The U.N. Climate Panel projects more floods, droughts, more powerful storms, heatwaves and rising sea levels from a
gradual build-up of heat-trapping gases from burning fossil fuels.
De Boer has in the past called Obama's goals an ""opening offer"" that he hopes will be toughened in Copenhagen.
Stern said that it was unclear whether Congress will manage to pass climate legislation before the Copenhagen meeting
in December. If a law is passed by then, he said, it would be unrealistic for Washington to sign up to any tougher cuts.
On Saturday, an estimated one billion people turned out the lights for an Earth Hour to show concern about global
warming. The action also dimmed landmarks from the Eiffel Tower to the Sydney Harbour Bridge.
""Earth hour was probably the largest public demonstration on climate change ever,"" de Boer said.

Dear Cheryl and Susan,
I am pleased to inform you that following two long conference calls with the Holocaust Survivors' Foundation and Sam
Dubbin, their lawyer, and with the timely intervention of Congressman Robert Wexler, the Foundation has sent the
letter below by FAX to Secretary Clinton, withdrawing their objection and supporting my efforts.
It was clear from the call that they are
to all the major Jewish organizations, from the
American Jewish Committee and ADL to the Jewish Claims Conference. But they are a voice we should hear,
Thanks and best wishes,
Stu

Dear Secretary Clinton:
With reference to our letter dated June 19, 2009, on behalf of the Holocaust Survivors Foundation USA, Inc. (HSF), I
would like to state that based on conversations that took place in the intervening time period between Ambassador
Eizenstat and the leadership of the HSF, and the commitments he made to our leaders, we are no longer asking that he
be replaced as the head of the U.S. delegation to the Prague Conference taking place on June 26-30.
On behalf of all of the survivors for whom we have been fighting over the last decade, including tens of thousands in
desperate need, we wish Ambassador Eizenstat the best of success as the head of the United States delegation at the
Conference, as well as in the follow-up activities that we understand will occur on matters affecting Holocaust survivors'
rights and interests.
Sincerely,
David Schaecter

A US Expo 2010 pavilion, after all.
http://shanghaiscrap.com/?p=3350
Filed under:Expo 2010, Expo 2010 - US Pavilion, US Politics — posted by Adam on July 11, 2009 @ 7:00 am
Coming at the end of a tumultuous week in China marked by earthquakes, riots, and continued economic
uncertainty, the news that the US had finally confirmed that its participation in Expo 2010 (a/k/a, next year's
world fair) didn't seem particularly significant. And, with much of Shanghai's foreign correspondent corps
preoccupied with more pressing news elsewhere in China, it didn't receive much coverage. Fair enough, I think.
However, insofar as the US pavilion – or lack thereof– had become an increasingly thorny diplomatic issue
between China and the United States, the signing ceremony was an important signal that some kind of
resolution was at hand.
I've been following the mostly sad saga of the US pavilion for several months now, both on Shanghai Scrap,
and elsewhere. And, until two weeks ago, there was absolutely no reason to believe that a participation
agreement would ever be signed. Shanghai Expo, Inc., a non-profit authorized by the US State Department to
fund-raise, design, build, and operate a US pavilion, had failed to raise sufficient funds to break ground. At
yesterday's signing ceremony, Beatrice Camp, the US Consul General in Shanghai blamed the underwhelming
fundraising on the global economic crisis – a point that was picked up by the Chinese media. No doubt, the
141
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05762764 Date: 06/30/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05762764 Date: 06/30/2015
economic crisis played a role, but as Camp and others close to the US effort surely know, the other important
factor was the inexperienced and increasingly erratic trio running the non-profit Shanghai Expo, Inc. As
recently as last month, one of its members — Frank Lavin, a former US ambassador to Singapore and
Undersecretary of Commerce — issued a press release falsely claiming that the US Congress had ""adopted"" a
resolution in support of the US pavilion. This incident; and others like it, succeeded in alienating potential
donors (including major US corporations with operations in China), vast swaths of the US expatriate business
community in Shanghai, and — most crucially — members of the Shanghai government. For those of us
following the events, the question was no longer ""How badly will the US damage its relationship with China if
it doesn't participate?"" but instead became ""What's worse for US-China relations? Turning down Shanghai's
Expo invite or continuing the current, incompetent effort?""
The July 1 appointment of Jose Villarreal as Commissioner General to the US pavilion effort seems to have
changed the equation. A lawyer with ties to the Clintons, Secretary of State Clinton empowered him to oversee
the US effort. He didn't waste any time, either, arriving in Shanghai on Monday, and managing to pull of the
signing on Friday. One person familiar with Villarreal's role described it as the arrival of an ""adult"" to a chaotic
situation that badly needed one. Indeed, if there's one telling detail to the handful of official and press accounts
of yesterday's signing, it's the total absence of the Shanghai Expo, Inc. members from the official comments
and photos (US Consulate coverage here; Shanghai government account here), none of whom live or work in
Shanghai, anyway. If that was a conscious decision, it was a wise one.
A final point. As Villarreal conceded, the US effort must still raise roughly half of its $61 million budget. I
suspect that — with Villarreal in charge of the effort — reluctant wallets will become less so. Regardless, though,
this raises a still unresolved question: namely, what are the actual fundraising rules for the US pavilion effort?
Back in 2007, the State Department indicated that it would not sign a participation agreement with Expo 2010,
Inc until all funds were raised for a pavilion. Apparently, that ill-conceived policy has changed. I say apparently
because, up until now, the State Department has refused to release the ""action plan"" that governs fundraising
and other rules related to the US pavilion in Shanghai. As a result of this official intransigence, a Freedom of
Information Act request has been filed to obtain this document(s?). Why the secrecy? It's anybody's guess, and
according to the State Department's FOIA office, we can keep guessing until Thanksgiving — it's around then
that they'll get around to releasing the documents.
[UPDATE: Just received notice that groundbreaking for the US pavilion will be on July 17 at 10:30 AM.
Secretary of Commerce Gary Locke will be present.]

Cheryl -
I understand from Susan that you and she both received word that a decision has finally been made. We have gotten
cleared around the building this evening a package with terrific help from 10 and DRL of a press statement, talking points
and a cable notifying posts of the decision. NSC has cleared as well. We will not launch until tomorrow at 2:00.
As part of the launch plan NSC has asked that we use quotes from Secretary Clinton and Ambassador Rice in the press
statement. We would like to work with whoever is appropriate (Jake and Robert?) traveling with the Secretary to get a
one sentence quote for the statement. Jennifer Simon on our staff will email you the draft statement shortly. Please let us
know with whom we should follow up as we want to ensure we preserve the close hold nature of this process.
Thanks - Erica
(P.S. Ops has left a message for you as well from me - this is the topic - feel free to call anytime if you'd prefer
discussing).

This is the follow-up info from the IAM after Tom Buffenbarger asked me to be in touch with you about a possible visit

Secretary Clinton —
I understand you are going to Kenya next week and while I know the trip is primarily focused on trade issues, I
wanted to flag an issue for you because I know it is near and dear to your heart.
Kenya has one of the strictest anti-abortion laws in Africa — it is illegal unless a woman's life is at risk and
criminalizes both the woman and the provider. Two years ago, Kenyan authorities imprisoned a doctor and
two nurses, falsely accusing them of providing illegal abortions. After a year in prison, the providers were
found innocent and released, but it galvanized the legal and provider community who formed a coalition to
make abortion less restrictive. It will come as no surprise to you that, as a result of their abortion law, Kenya
has one of the highest maternal mortality rates in all of Africa, with an estimated 800 women a day seeking
the procedure, often through dangerous means.
Kenya is restarting a long-stalled constitutional review process and they hope to produce a final Constitution
by next year. Religious groups are on a concerted crusade to include new language in the Constitution which
would codify that ""life begins at conception"". The current Constitution is largely silent on the issue. If this fetal
personhood amendment goes forward, it would place Kenya in the small community of nations with such a
provision. It would clearly mark Kenya as out of stop with countries attempting to institutionalize the African
Union's Maputo Protocol, one of the most progressive regional documents on women, development and
reproductive rights, and with the vast majority of African countries in general. For a country trying to regain
the momentum of stability and success it enjoyed until recently, such a policy imposition would be a
regression for women's rights and for the country writ large.
I went to Kenya last month to work with the coalition that has formed to strategize against the Constitutional
amendment and to work toward a less restrictive abortion law. I also visited several of our clinics and
providers in Nairobi and in nearby villages where Planned Parenthood has programs to train providers in post
abortion care. You have seen this a million times in your travels around the world, so I don't need to tell you
how poignant the stories were of the lives saved and lost, the bravery in standing up to constant government
harassment, and the fear of what this potential Constitutional amendment will mean to the provision of safe
medical services. I know it is asking a lot, but if there is any way that you could draw attention to this issue
when you are in Kenya, you would be even more of my personal hero than you already are. It is our hope that

happy to help you in any way if you decide you want to do something on this while you are there. There is also
a Congressional delegation going to Kenya the week of August 8th and we are working on them to have a side

are the most urgent needs among the 280,000 civilians now in overcrowded camps. UNSYG Ban will travel to

Clinton, in Iraq, Blames 'Rejectionists' for Violence By MARK LANDLER BAGHDAD — Secretary of State Hillary Rodham
Clinton arrived here Saturday morning for a one-day visit, delivering an American show of support for Iraq as it battles a
sudden eruption of violence, in the wake of suicide bombings that killed at least 140 people and wounded several
hundred more on Thursday and Friday.
Mrs. Clinton, in her first visit to Baghdad as secretary of state, acknowledged that the attacks were worrisome. She said
she would seek a briefing on the security situation from the American military commander, Gen. Ray Odierno, in her first
meeting on Saturday, a day packed with appointments.
But she played down suggestions that the attacks augured a return to the relentless sectarian violence that convulsed
Iraq in 2006. She said they did not signal that a new jihadist movement was taking root in Iraq, which could derail the
progress the country has made in the last two years.
""In Iraq, there will always be political conflicts,"" Mrs. Clinton said to reporters before setting off on the unannounced
visit Friday evening. ""But I really believe that Iraq, as a whole, is on the right track.""
She characterized the latest bout of violence as the last gasp of ""rejectionists"" who fear that the government will
succeed in creating a united and peaceful Iraq. The suicide bombings, she said, are ""in an unfortunately tragic way, a
signal that the rejectionists fear that Iraq is going in the right direction.""
""Are there going to be bad days? Yes, there are,"" Mrs. Clinton said. But she added, ""If you look at the evidence,
overwhelmingly the progress that's been made has been positive.""
The Obama administration, she said, was determined to help Iraq achieve ""stability, sovereignty, and self-reliance,"" as
the United States prepares to pull out the last of its troops by the end of 2011.
Mrs. Clinton has been a regular visitor here, coming three times as a senator to chart the progress of a war she voted to
authorize, but later said had been mismanaged by the Bush administration. She said she was pleased to be back, though
the attacks have cast a shadow over her visit.
While the violence is far below the worst levels in 2006, 18 major attacks this month have kindled fears that Baathist and
jihadist elements could be reconstituting themselves into a smaller, but still deadly, insurgency that will exploit the
withdrawal of American troops between now and 2011.
Mrs. Clinton compared these latest suicide bombings to a spectacular terrorist attack that occurred several months after
the Good Friday peace accord ended years of conflict in Northern Ireland.
At times, her analysis almost echoed that of former Vice President Dick Cheney and former Defense Secretary Donald
Rumsfeld. When the sectarian violence was relentless several years ago, Mr. Cheney spoke of the insurgency being in its
""last throes,"" while Mr. Rumsfeld talked of ""dead-enders"" who kept fighting a lost cause.
On Friday, Gen. David Petraeus, the head of the military's Central Command, testified before a House appropriations
committee that the suicide bombers may have been part of a militant network based in Tunisia. Four of the bombers, he
said, were from Tunisia.
Mrs. Clinton said she did not have specific information on the bombers, but said: ""We've seen suicide bombers from
many countries in Iraq over the last six years. It's unfortunate that young men, and occasionally even a young woman,
would travel to Iraq to kill other people in that way.""
41
The violence did not seem to curtail Mrs. Clinton's ambitions for her brief visit. In addition to General Odierno, she was
scheduled to meet a retinue of Iraqi leaders, including the president, Jalal Talabani; the prime minister, Nuni Kamal al-
Maliki; and the foreign minister, Hoshyar Zebari.
She is also playing host at a roundtable of Iraqi women, something she has done in previous trips to Iraq. And she is to
hold a town-hall meeting with Iraqi students, as well as members of nongovernmental organizations and provincial
reconstruction teams.
This is a format Mrs. Clinton savored as a presidential candidate, and that, as secretary of state, she has used from South
Korea to Turkey. ""I want to listen,"" she said, ""I want to respond to their questions and concerns. I want some feedback
and ideas of about how are we going to make this transition as successful as possible.""
When President Obama visited Baghdad earlier this month, dusty skies prevented him from traveling by helicopter from
Baghdad International Airport into the city. He met with Mr. Maliki at a palace near the airport and General Odierno at
the American base, Camp Victory.
The new American ambassador, Christopher R. Hill, beat Mrs. Clinton to Baghdad by one day. He was confirmed by the
Senate on Tuesday after a lengthy process that was held up by Republican senators, who objected to his lack of
experience in the Arab world and his handling of negotiations with North Korea over its nuclear weapons program.
In Iraq, Mr. Hill will spearhead the shift in emphasis by the United States from military to civilian operations. Some Iraq
experts said the American civilian presence here had been lacking momentum since the departure in February of the last
United States ambassador, Ryan C. Crocker.","UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05761349 Date: 06/30/2015

the Good Friday peace accord ended years of conflict in Northern Ireland.
At times, her analysis almost echoed that of former Vice President Dick Cheney and former Defense Secretary Donald
Rumsfeld. When the sectarian violence was relentless several years ago, Mr. Cheney spoke of the insurgency being in its
""last throes,"" while Mr. Rumsfeld talked of ""dead-enders"" who kept fighting a lost cause.
On Friday, Gen. David Petraeus, the head of the military's Central Command, testified before a House appropriations
committee that the suicide bombers may have been part of a militant network based in Tunisia. Four of the bombers, he
said, were from Tunisia.
Mrs. Clinton said she did not have specific information on the bombers, but said: ""We've seen suicide bombers from
many countries in Iraq over the last six years. It's unfortunate that young men, and occasionally even a young woman,
would travel to Iraq to kill other people in that way.""

The violence did not seem to curtail Mrs. Clinton's ambitions for her brief visit. In addition to General Odierno, she was
scheduled to meet a retinue of Iraqi leaders, including the president, Jalal Talabani; the prime minister, Nuni Kamal al-
Maliki; and the foreign minister, Hoshyar Zebari.
She is also playing host at a roundtable of Iraqi women, something she has done in previous trips to Iraq. And she is to
hold a town-hall meeting with Iraqi students, as well as members of nongovernmental organizations and provincial
reconstruction teams.
This is a format Mrs. Clinton savored as a presidential candidate, and that, as secretary of state, she has used from South
Korea to Turkey. ""I want to listen,"" she said, ""I want to respond to their questions and concerns. I want some feedback
and ideas of about how are we going to make this transition as successful as possible.""
When President Obama visited Baghdad earlier this month, dusty skies prevented him from traveling by helicopter from
Baghdad International Airport into the city. He met with Mr. Maliki at a palace near the airport and General Odierno at
the American base, Camp Victory.
The new American ambassador, Christopher R. Hill, beat Mrs. Clinton to Baghdad by one day. He was confirmed by the
Senate on Tuesday after a lengthy process that was held up by Republican senators, who objected to his lack of
experience in the Arab world and his handling of negotiations with North Korea over its nuclear weapons program.
In Iraq, Mr. Hill will spearhead the shift in emphasis by the United States from military to civilian operations. Some Iraq
experts said the American civilian presence here had been lacking momentum since the departure in February of the last
United States ambassador, Ryan C. Crocker.

Re: Your CFR speech
1. This draft, sent by separate email, is intended to give you options and ideas. Use as you
wish. Several ideas are at the core of this version: in particular, the concept of the US as a
modern global nation and how that serves our capacity for leadership.
2. For most policy speeches a generic tone and workmanlike prose are acceptable. But for
this one, it is not. This speech can't afford to be lackluster. It will then be held up in
invidious comparison to Obama's glittering best efforts. Your speech must have, amid the
policies, a distinctive and authoritative voice.
3. Your early draft makes no distinctions between allies or partners; indeed, it barely
mentions allies. The early draft also features a strong malaise theme. Even if rebutted
after being raised, the focus is on obstacles and hindrances, not on achievements,
opportunities and what can be achieved. There's no accounting of progress so far. The
effect is downbeat in tone. At the same time, the draft contains passages of vague and
gauzy liberal universalism, while in one line assailing it, an unconvincing juggling act.
The notion that all nations and peoples want the same things as Americans will not fly
and is open to derision. It reflects blithe liberal cultural imperialism, among other things.
(See Graham Greene. And, on the contrary, some nations—and peoples—seek nuclear
weapons, like Iran; some don't want to curb global warming, like China; some don't care
about human rights, like most Arab nations; some have contempt for democracy,
including de facto allies like Egypt, not to mention Myanmar; and some are indifferent to
poverty, any number of African kleptocracies.) Also there is some confusion of
definitions, for example, asserting dialogue with adversaries is ""strategic engagement,""
when that is a concept usually applied to allies and partners.
4. The speech must be crafted with a sense of real time and cannot be delivered out of sync
with it. Slogans can become shopworn, especially those that lack analytical, historical
and descriptive power. What served you once, at your confirmation, may not serve again
in the same way. The most cogent foreign policy columnists from Clive Crook of the
Financial Times to David Rothkopf of Foreign Policy have already written columns in
the last week on the limits of ""soft power"" (i.e., ""smart power"") and others I understand
are preparing to make similar criticisms. I would use sparingly or not at all. You do not

Cheryl:
I imagine everything is quite crazy at the moment. I did not want to bother you today but would greatly appreciate it if
you would please pass along my good wishes to HRC for a fast and good recovery. Hope she will be back on track
soon. I am of course happy to help out in any way I can.
Also wanted to give you an update on ECA. Following up on our conversation over the weekend and as per your
direction I have had a number of good conversations with the ECA team including Mara. Happy to report we are all on
the same page with the career folks fully endorsing the plan. Details as follows:
• Grantee has been sanctioned
• IG is conducting investigation of grantee
• No further grants will be awarded to grantee pending outcome of IG investigation; probable outcome will be
delisting of grantee
• Working with Pat Kennedy to develop plan for spot checks of all grantees and random student checks
using existing Department resources
The IG investigation started today and as you predicted more information came out in the first meeting which led Miller
to request a full investigation of the Youth Services Program which I agreed to.
Pi did the CNN interview this a.m. No doubt it will be a tough story but according to Miller it was an honest discussion.
Have been keeping Casey's office in the loop and I plan to visit him personally. In the meantime I would like to move as
soon as possible to put someone into the A/S position on an acting basis. Do you have anyone in mind or would you like
me to make some suggestions?
