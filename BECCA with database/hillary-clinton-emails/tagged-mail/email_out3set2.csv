I have asked Jose to get you a more detailed report but I must tell you the opening of the USA Pavilion has been a great
success so far - at least among the expo-goers. A few vignettes.
- while we don't want to brag to our Chinese hosts, our Pavilion has become the most popular. During the trial runs last
week, the Chinese expo-goers rushed directly from the gates to the USAP (and even broke some of our turn-styles).
Needless to say, the Chinese have improved security. On EACH of the first two days, 30,000 pple visited. Lines are long
and pple are loving the show. We are also getting many foreign officials to visit.
- the 100 US college student ambassadors (who act as guides and speak Mandarin) are the biggest hits of the pavilion.
Fair-goers stand in line to have their photo's taken w them. They explain the show and send a great message.
- the story line that we thght was simplistic is quite popular (the overture where Americans try to say hello in mandarin
is met w howls of laughter and Act II called the Garden is doing well). During the thunderstorm scene a mist comes from
the ceiling and some pple put up their umbrellas. Act I is a bit too commercial but the audience claps and take photo's
when you and President come on the screen.
- we are selling tons of USA merchandise - the two most popular items - mini-basketballs with the USAP seal on it and
the bison stuffed animals - who knew?
Anyway, thght u'd enjoy the quick report. I cannot imagine us not being here! We will keep you posted.
Smart power works!

Colleagues, the latest from Amb. Feinstein of Embassy Warsaw. In short, the crash took the lives of many of Poland's
senior civilian and military leadership; succession/transition will be the first major test of Poland's constitution. The
speaker of the lower house of parliament, Bronislaw Komorowski, will temporarily assume the presidency. The
constitution requires he call for presidential elections within 14 days and that elections take place within 60 days. An
unofficial manifest is included. Rgds, H.

All,
This is going out as a cable momentarily. The main point is that the.crash killed not only the President and his wife but a
broad swath of Poland's top national security leadership. In this sense it is an unprecedented governmental tragedy,
and a test of Poland's constitution. The sitrep follows.

Shortly before 1000 Warsaw time, a Polish government Tu-154 plane carrying a delegation headed by Polish President
Lech Kaczynski crashed in heavy fog at the airport in Smolensk, Russia. Russian officials have told the press that there
were no survivors; the foreign ministry spokesman said there were 88 passengers on board. The delegation was en
route to ceremonies hosted by the Russian government to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the Katyn massacres.
There is as yet not government confirmation of the deaths, but there is no expectation of survivors.
Speaker of the Polish Sejm (the lower house of parliament) Bronislaw Komorowski is en route to Warsaw to take over
the powers of the presidency and those of the Commander in Chief, according to press reports. According to the Polish
constitution, if the president dies in office, the Speaker temporarily assumes the presidency, and has 14 days to
announce the date of special presidential elections. The elections must be held within 60 days of his announcement.
This is the first major test of the Polish constitution, and the government is itself sorting out the details of the procedure
in this unprecedented circumstance.
Prime Minister Tusk is returning from Gdansk to Warsaw, and will chair a meeting of the Council of Ministers at 1P local
time. Tusk has received condolence telephone calls from Russian Prime Minister Putin, German Chancellor Angela
Merkel, and other world leaders.
The magnitude of the loss is difficult to overstate including, in addition to the President and the First Lady, the top
national security leadership of the Presidential Chancellery, the head of Poland's armed forces, all or nearly all of
Poland's military chiefs, a deputy minister of defense, a deputy foreign minister, a presidential candidate, and members
of Parliament. Crowds of people with candles and flowers have started to assemble in front of the presidential palace in
downtown Warsaw. A mass in honor of those who died will be held later this afternoon. Poland is in shock and entering
a period of deep national mourning.
Below is an unofficial and incomplete manifest of those who are on the plane. Among them are:
President Lech Kaczynski
First Lady Maria Kaczynska
Former President Ryszard Kaczorowski
Wladislaw Stasiak, Chief of the Chancellery of the President of the Republic of Poland

There is a context section at the bottom, which is longer than I would like, but I
think it is important to articulate what I saw and whom I spoke with (and what I
didn't see and whom I didn't meet) so that you understand my data set and its clear
limitations. To say I was profoundly disturbed by what I saw - and didn't see -
would be an understatement. The incompetence is mind numbing. Not incidentally,
it rained twice while I was there. If we do not quickly change the organization,
management, accountability and delivery paradigm on the ground, we could quite
conceivably confront tens of thousands of children's deaths by diarrhea, dysentery,
typhoid and other water-related diseases in the near future. Below are my major
takeaways and a few nascent/early thoughts on what we (however we define we)
could to do drive significant and incremental improvements on the ground in the
near and longer term. As is often said, if I had more time - and less emotion - I
would have written a shorter letter. I hope this mini-behemoth is not rife with
grammatical errors or inadvertent gaps; I am sorry if either true.
Please do not forward this in whole or in part attributed to me without asking me
first - happy to be an invisible soldier. Mainly hope this is even marginally helpful.
Thanks,
Chelsea
Takeaways are below, with illustrative examples, in a logical flow, not order of
importance. Bolded what I think most important.:
Haitians want to help themselves and want the international community to
help them help themselves - this sounds obvious but wasn't to some of the
UN and International NGO (INGO) folks I ran across. The UN people I
encountered were frequently out of touch (e.g., would not have been off
Logbase in days - or ever), anachronistic at best and arrogant and
incompetent at worst (e.g., one woman from the UN -UNDP I think - told me
she was waiting for the Haitians to ""demand their political rights"" - when
they're asking for tents, latrines, soap, food and not getting that....)
In fact, Haitians in the settlements are very much organizing themselves,
in part to help define their needs and then articulate them to the UN/
INGO community. Fairly nuanced settlement governance structures
have already developed. The largest settlement I visited in Parc Jean Marie
Vincent (40k and counting) had an overall governing committee with a head
of the governing committee (voted on by the governing committee); a
women's committee; a security committee; a sanitation committee (with a
soap subcommittee), etc. Women comprised 50% of each committee. One of
the most illuminating anecdotes from my trip was talking with the head of
the security committee and a few other settlement residents, including 2
women from the governing committee. The security committee wanted 100
tshirts - at least though I think they'll need at least 2-3x that - so that the
security volunteers could wear them when patrolling so that people,
particularly women, would feel safe when they saw them approach in groups
of 2 or 3. They also ideally wanted flashlights to also use on night patrol.
Finally, they wanted to be able to pay the security team (though this was less
important than the first two 'asks'). IF that option were not feasible, their
second choice was for the US Army to come into the settlement and patrol at
night. Not the Haitian police (unreliable) and not the UN (dismissed). They
wanted to help themselves, and they wanted reliability and accountability.
The settlements' governing bodies - as they shared with me - are
beginning to experience UN/ INGO fatigue given how often they articulate
their needs, willingness to work - and how little is coming their way. Tents
and latrines / sanitation remain the largest urgent needs - obvious to
anyone with a minimum knowledge of public health and the settlement
residents themselves
The Haitian government appears to have an emergent, albeit still
largely lacking in specifics, plan of action (detailed below), for both the
near (to get through the next 6-12 months) and longer term (while
rebuilding over next -5 years)
The Haitian government's inability to articulate its plan quickly enough
or in sufficient terms to the UN/ INGO community has lead to a
proliferation of ad hoc efforts by the UN and INGOs to 'help,' some of
which have helped (e.g., we met no one who was worried about water
supplies in camps even though it's a motley crue of French Red Cross, Oxfam,
IMO/IOM, etc that have achieved that), some of which have hurt (e.g., the
largest settlement we visited had 1 latrine to every 1,000 people or 40 for
-40k though given the settlements' growth rate its probably 40 for -45k
today; there should be 1 for every 50 people or 800+ latrines) and some
which have not happened at all (e.g., the only settlements with lights at
night are those in areas that had lights before that continue to work;
settlement at the Petionville Golf Club, for instance, has some lights at night
while most sit in darkness)
This disorganization across the UN/ INGOs has had a variety of effects
on the Haitian government, including that it it has now visibly distanced
itself from the UN Cluster process (e.g., instead of going to a meeting a day
the Haitian Minister of Health is now going once a week - because it was
""such a waste of time"" and he said that is representative of the government's
current modus operandi); though we heard the cluster process was
improving - when I asked for a concrete example of how, I was told meetings
were ""more efficient."" This lack of efficiency - not to mention lack of visible
consistent progress - has also lead to a further distrust of the UN/ INGOs
by the Haitian government and Haitian people in the settlements. The
former feels like it shows up to no effect - and the latter feels like very
few actor(s) reliably show up
Again, the UN seemed at best chaotic and at worst absent as I travelled
around in an action-oriented sense - I saw few IOM/IMO tents in settlements
or workers or evidence of work; no evidence of WHO; no evidence of OSHA;
no evidence of... You get the picture. I did see lots of UN peacekeepers riding
around however in their vans, humvees, etc. Though on the point of trucks, I
asked how many trucks were in the country - including the non-Port Au
Prince UN 'bases' - and no one could tell me. There appears to be NO
accessible and usable UN inventory system or logistics operation. WFP,
for instance, is largely piggy backing on the US Army/ SOUTHCOM but the
""UN"" / OSHA could not tell me how many trucks WFP had, much less how
many the UN itself had. I counted - I kid you not - hundreds of trucks and
cars at the UN logbase and other UN bases we drove by
UNICEF was the only UN agency that seemed to be universally
acknowledged to be doing a good job by settlements' residents, by
Haitian doctors and by INGO partners, perhaps in part because of its
narrowly defined agenda currently in Haiti (vaccinations) and that its
reliable - i.e., it shows up when it says it will in the settlements and other
central locations
There is NO accountability in the UN system or international
humanitarian system (including for/ among INGOs), this is not new news
but it is one area that the Cluster approach had aimed to remedy - e.g., there
is no feedback mechanism for when the British Red Cross dug the 34 of the
40 above latrines only 3 feet deep and didn't tell the residents when they
would come and extract the latrines or properly train people to take care of
the latrines, etc. - that malpractice continuum is appalling and the British
Red Cross should know better—at the least, the British Red Cross
subsequently should not be allowed to dig elsewhere/ 'do' latrines
The cash-for-work program the UN heralds is not working optimally, to
put it mildly. It currently focuses - perhaps solely - on debris cleaning -
important no doubt - but it has not extended its work into the
settlements or helped set standardized, and differentiated wages, for
settlement work. For instance, the UN cash for work program should have
already started to pay people in the more organized camps - to clean
latrines; 'guard' latrines, including insuring kids use soap; be teachers; be on
security patrol; be on evacuation duty; work with the WFP during the XYZ
drop times, etc.... NONE of this is happening as far as I can tell. When we
were there the cash for work program head was still focused only - it
appeared - on rubble cleaning.
Re: education in the settlements and beyond: This is theoretically the
responsibility of UNICEF and Save the Children - I heard they're starting to
work on this but that is all I know. Ad hoc schools have begun in some of the
camps. We met a woman - our host in fact - who working with the Israeli
Agency for International Development Cooperation - had started schools in 4
settlements for at least the next month.
The World Food Program continues to NOT buy locally - which is
probably now a moot point as it appears that the dairy, fruit, vegetable and
grain stores have all spoiled. The WFP also seems to have been rather erratic
in the early days but most people I spoke to said WFP is now more
systematic and reliable in its food delivery. However, it had not yet
started to deliver cooking and eating utensils though these are promised for
next week.
In contrast to the UN, there appears to be respect for the US Military on
the ground - for the Army particularly as that is the branch people see
guarding the hospital - and it is a negative comment on the UN forces given
their effective absence. I saw no anti-US graffiti though the walls now are
covered in parts of downtown with anti 'ONG' (NGO) and anti-UN graffiti.
(Also, not only graffiti writers with the above sentiments; one of the Haitian
doctors I met said, ""We must be so poor we can't tell them [UN and INGOs]
what to do - or kick them out and use the money ourselves.""). There is also
great fear - at least from the Haitian and ex-pat medical community-
that the Army is leaving soon largely because of the security and total
organization vacuum that would then be left around the hospital. The
UN community, in contrast, did not seem to be perturbed by this prospect.
On an unrelated note, the absence of the Catholic Church's efforts is
notable, particularly given the high death toll among priests, nuns and
seminarians. Catholic Relief Services is present.
Thoughts on what is needed - and what we could do below. (I know much of this
is familiar.):
The Office of Special Envoy - i.e., you Dad - needs authority over the UN
and all its myriad parts - which I do believe would give you effective
authority over much of then INGO sphere given how persistently the
collective humanitarian community holding onto cluster approach. I know
you know this and are working on it. OSHA clearly is failing on the ground,
otherwise it could be ""empowered"" to do this but it ostensibly already is.
However, regardless of the attachment to clusters, there needs to be a
single point of authority either over UN / INGO efforts on the ground
organized in one of two principle ways: either expertise areas (e.g.,
latrines, lights) or by settlements/ Port Au Prince regions with constituent
settlements, with full structures - e.g., finance, procurement, project
management etc., understanding certain functional areas would be cross-
cutting (e.g., pay for work)
There needs to be a coordinated logistics effort which should follow from
the above with an urgency on procurement and deployment of latrines,
tents and lights - and what is needed to support installment, servicing,
maintenance, etc of each. In parallel, a new logistics center/ warehouse
coordinating facility should be built; every non-UN logistics-focused person I
talked to said a need exists for a new logistic center near the major seaport.
A plan must be developed for the rainy season, which is already on us,
particularly for the settlements and it should include answers to questions
like where can people evacuate to when it rains? How will they access food
and water and latrines, at a minimum, from those spaces? Also, could those
places be multipurpose, e.g., also schools and clinic tents/semi permanent
structures (one engineer talked to me about fiberglass?)?
On pay for work, UN needs to expand its mandate and coordinate with
relevant INGO partners to start employing people, at differential wages, in
the settlements and coordinate with the groups above to ensure consistent
wages until a 'market' could develop
The UN - IMO/IOM - or someone needs to take a monthly census of the
settlements at the minimum
Speaking of censuses, the UN also needs a census of itself and its materials
in country - including of the peacekeeper bases outside Port Au Prince.
For example, we drove by 2 bases on the way to Cange and there were
collectively, I would estimate, more than a hundred trucks and buses just
sitting between the two, as well as at least 800 Napali soldiers (according to
locals) laying effectively fallow - and I don't think anyone expects an
outbreak of violence on the Central Plateau in the near future so even if they
and their colleagues are deployed under UN Charter Chapter 6, surely
preserving the peace could be interpreted to work with the settlements? At
the least, their hardware could be used more effectively in Port Au Prince
Special/ extraordinary management needed around areas that have
received significant attention and offers of assistance, e.g., the general
hospital in Port Au Prince which multiple actors, including Sarkozy, have
now offered to rebuild
Holistically, all of the above should support the Haitian government both
actually and ostensibly to not undermine its authority and also to help
augment and build local capacity and capabilities, where feasible
The UN/ INGO should look to source locally or work with local partners
whenever possible, post emergency phase at the least. For example, work
with local solar light producers, buy from local t-shirt factories (if any
survived outside Port Au Prince), mandate WFP first look to local producers,
etc. Now bias I think has to be on quickest production but in medium term
that should accommodate a local dimension
Re: USNS Comfort: for as long as it is there, at a minimum, its mission
should be expanded such that its military and civilian staff could work
on the physical therapy of earthquake related victims and ideally care for
non-earthquake related cases.
Re: US Army: If its mission is largely coming to an end, I hope there is a
succession plan for its current tasks, e.g., the hospital security, that the
Haitian government is comfortable with; currently Haitian government/ at
least Haitian government people on the proverbial ground have no idea what
the transfer plan is
Re: medical evacuations: think this will be improved given our collectively-
experienced chaos on Sunday
Re: mental health in settlements and beyond: clear people are thinking
about this now - largely because Dad asked about it and made it prominent -
but still unclear what the action plan is
Re: Haitian plan: I am not sure it's the best plan, but it is a plan and we
should work with the government to flush out the details so it is robust and
actionable - not sure who the we is here probably most of all
Re: Catholic church: Could we reach out to the Vatican - or even Catholic
groups/ prominent Catholics domestically to raise money and the necessary
expertise to rebuild the central cathedral and main seminary? It would
be a powerful symbolic statement - and put lots of people to work
Re: status, including mental health of workers there, both Haitian and
ex-pat: I am consciously leaving this off as I just can't process right now
FYI: Emergent Haitian government plan of action, as I understand it:
o Near term/ for the next year
? Buttress the settlements that currently exist that are not
in the lowest lying flood plans, i.e., get tents and latrines in
place, ensure sufficient amounts of clean water flowing in or
being brought, ensure food supplies sufficient, ensure security
and safety (though this seems to be people-focused only);
ensure medical care accessible; start schools at least for the
youngest children.
? Move people who are in the settlements in the worst
geographies for flooding or practical reasons/ other
reasons (e.g., the one currently with 4000 people on the prime
minister's lawn) to pre-constructed tent settlements
elsewhere - they have built the first of these already with INGO
Shelter Box though apparently the tents were put up too close
to one another
• Areas lacking in mention when I heard the above
discussed: a solution to ensure people have somewhere to go
when the heavy rains come; ensure continuity of key services
once the rains come; a solution to ensure people are paid how
to ensure sufficient light in the camps, clearly critical to
security (rapes are skyrocketing and I know there were at least
2 murders in one camp on Saturday night); what the right spec
of tent is for any of the above - housing, clinic, evacuation,
school and what could be multipurpose; plan for older
children/young adults who may be too old for initial school
plan; how to best support / help create where needed
settlement governance; how to census, on a semi-regular basis,
who is in the settlements
® Over next 6-12 months:
o Assess which homes are sufficiently safe for families
to return to and subsequently encourage them to do
so; government estimates this will be —30% of all
homes/families (though this seems to be a guess, i.e., no
evidence base)
• Build semi-permanent settlements or augment pre-
existing villages around Port Au Prince where
feasible to enable the government to move people
out of settlements to those sites. End goal is to move
400-1000 families to each of these as needed
o Longer-term:
• Rebuilt Port Au Prince though it is unclear how/if/why people
would move back or what the government's post-rebuild
vision looks like
? Build more robust health, education etc systems than existed
before the earthquake
? *Clearly this is the less well-defined part of the ""plan""
Context
I spent the last four days in Haiti. I was with Paul Farmer (Paul) and Partners in
Health (PIH) the entire time - in Port Au Prince Thursday, Friday and Sunday
afternoon and at PIH sites in Laconville and Cange, in the Central Plateau region
Saturday and Sunday morning. I sat in on Paul's formal meetings in Port Au Prince
with: the Haitian Minister of Health Alex Larsen and his team; the Haitian
government official ostensibly overseeing the reconstruction efforts/ UN liaison
Leslie Voltaire; a x-UN group preparing for the PDNA (post disaster needs
assessment) conference in New York at the end of March working on giving 'voice to
the voiceless,' i.e., the designated 15minutes at the conference to highlight the voices
of those most affected (the 15 minutes I gather are happening at all only because of
Cheryl and Paul), UNDP, UNHCR and others were represented; a group interested in
building a logistics center for the reconstruction efforts, i.e., outside the UN ambit,
including people from Royal Caribbean, McKinsey and the people we were traveling
with, including Wes Edens, CEO of Fortress and a supporter of PIH - and the person
who donated, and continues to donate the space at the Miami airport that PIH,
Clinton Foundation, University of Miami Medical Center and others are using to
move goods by air and sea, via transfer, to Haiti. Informally, I talked with: people in
settlements and settlement committee heads, through a translator; local Haitian
doctors; ex-pat PIH and other doctors in mobile clinics in settlements; doctors,
nurses and US police officers I ran into on the street, at dinner, at their ad hoc
residence in the abandoned Aristide Foundation; Maryse Kedar who hosted us our
nights in Port Au Prince, a member of the local elite, and her ad hoc Israel volunteers
(from the Israeli Agency for International Development Cooperation, ie their USAID,
as mentioned above); a broad swath of people serving on the USNS Comfort, both on
and off the ship; US Army enlisted and officers whenever I saw them; Louise Ivers,
head of PIH in Haiti, and others we met or ran into along the way.","UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05774208 Date: 08/31/2015
RELEASE IN FULL
To: Dad, Mom
Cc: Cheryl, Doug, Justin
There is a context section at the bottom, which is longer than I would like, but I
think it is important to articulate what I saw and whom I spoke with (and what I
didn't see and whom I didn't meet) so that you understand my data set and its clear
limitations. To say I was profoundly disturbed by what I saw - and didn't see -
would be an understatement. The incompetence is mind numbing. Not incidentally,
it rained twice while I was there. If we do not quickly change the organization,
management, accountability and delivery paradigm on the ground, we could quite
conceivably confront tens of thousands of children's deaths by diarrhea, dysentery,
typhoid and other water-related diseases in the near future. Below are my major
takeaways and a few nascent/early thoughts on what we (however we define we)
could to do drive significant and incremental improvements on the ground in the
near and longer term. As is often said, if I had more time - and less emotion - I
would have written a shorter letter. I hope this mini-behemoth is not rife with
grammatical errors or inadvertent gaps; I am sorry if either true.
Please do not forward this in whole or in part attributed to me without asking me
first - happy to be an invisible soldier. Mainly hope this is even marginally helpful.
Thanks,
Chelsea
Takeaways are below, with illustrative examples, in a logical flow, not order of
importance. Bolded what I think most important.:
Haitians want to help themselves and want the international community to
help them help themselves - this sounds obvious but wasn't to some of the
UN and International NGO (INGO) folks I ran across. The UN people I
encountered were frequently out of touch (e.g., would not have been off
Logbase in days - or ever), anachronistic at best and arrogant and
incompetent at worst (e.g., one woman from the UN -UNDP I think - told me
she was waiting for the Haitians to ""demand their political rights"" - when
they're asking for tents, latrines, soap, food and not getting that....)
In fact, Haitians in the settlements are very much organizing themselves,
in part to help define their needs and then articulate them to the UN/
INGO community. Fairly nuanced settlement governance structures
have already developed. The largest settlement I visited in Parc Jean Marie
Vincent (40k and counting) had an overall governing committee with a head
of the governing committee (voted on by the governing committee); a
women's committee; a security committee; a sanitation committee (with a
soap subcommittee), etc. Women comprised 50% of each committee. One of
the most illuminating anecdotes from my trip was talking with the head of
the security committee and a few other settlement residents, including 2
women from the governing committee. The security committee wanted 100
tshirts - at least though I think they'll need at least 2-3x that - so that the
security volunteers could wear them when patrolling so that people,

particularly women, would feel safe when they saw them approach in groups
of 2 or 3. They also ideally wanted flashlights to also use on night patrol.
Finally, they wanted to be able to pay the security team (though this was less
important than the first two 'asks'). IF that option were not feasible, their
second choice was for the US Army to come into the settlement and patrol at
night. Not the Haitian police (unreliable) and not the UN (dismissed). They
wanted to help themselves, and they wanted reliability and accountability.
The settlements' governing bodies - as they shared with me - are
beginning to experience UN/ INGO fatigue given how often they articulate
their needs, willingness to work - and how little is coming their way. Tents
and latrines / sanitation remain the largest urgent needs - obvious to
anyone with a minimum knowledge of public health and the settlement
residents themselves
The Haitian government appears to have an emergent, albeit still
largely lacking in specifics, plan of action (detailed below), for both the
near (to get through the next 6-12 months) and longer term (while
rebuilding over next -5 years)
The Haitian government's inability to articulate its plan quickly enough
or in sufficient terms to the UN/ INGO community has lead to a
proliferation of ad hoc efforts by the UN and INGOs to 'help,' some of
which have helped (e.g., we met no one who was worried about water
supplies in camps even though it's a motley crue of French Red Cross, Oxfam,
IMO/IOM, etc that have achieved that), some of which have hurt (e.g., the
largest settlement we visited had 1 latrine to every 1,000 people or 40 for
-40k though given the settlements' growth rate its probably 40 for -45k
today; there should be 1 for every 50 people or 800+ latrines) and some
which have not happened at all (e.g., the only settlements with lights at
night are those in areas that had lights before that continue to work;
settlement at the Petionville Golf Club, for instance, has some lights at night
while most sit in darkness)
This disorganization across the UN/ INGOs has had a variety of effects
on the Haitian government, including that it it has now visibly distanced
itself from the UN Cluster process (e.g., instead of going to a meeting a day
the Haitian Minister of Health is now going once a week - because it was
""such a waste of time"" and he said that is representative of the government's
current modus operandi); though we heard the cluster process was
improving - when I asked for a concrete example of how, I was told meetings
were ""more efficient."" This lack of efficiency - not to mention lack of visible
consistent progress - has also lead to a further distrust of the UN/ INGOs
by the Haitian government and Haitian people in the settlements. The
former feels like it shows up to no effect - and the latter feels like very
few actor(s) reliably show up
Again, the UN seemed at best chaotic and at worst absent as I travelled
around in an action-oriented sense - I saw few IOM/IMO tents in settlements
or workers or evidence of work; no evidence of WHO; no evidence of OSHA;
no evidence of... You get the picture. I did see lots of UN peacekeepers riding

succession plan for its current tasks, e.g., the hospital security, that the
Haitian government is comfortable with; currently Haitian government/ at
least Haitian government people on the proverbial ground have no idea what
the transfer plan is
Re: medical evacuations: think this will be improved given our collectively-
experienced chaos on Sunday
Re: mental health in settlements and beyond: clear people are thinking
about this now - largely because Dad asked about it and made it prominent -
but still unclear what the action plan is
Re: Haitian plan: I am not sure it's the best plan, but it is a plan and we
should work with the government to flush out the details so it is robust and
actionable - not sure who the we is here probably most of all

Re: Catholic church: Could we reach out to the Vatican - or even Catholic
groups/ prominent Catholics domestically to raise money and the necessary
expertise to rebuild the central cathedral and main seminary? It would
be a powerful symbolic statement - and put lots of people to work
Re: status, including mental health of workers there, both Haitian and
ex-pat: I am consciously leaving this off as I just can't process right now
FYI: Emergent Haitian government plan of action, as I understand it:
o Near term/ for the next year
? Buttress the settlements that currently exist that are not
in the lowest lying flood plans, i.e., get tents and latrines in
place, ensure sufficient amounts of clean water flowing in or
being brought, ensure food supplies sufficient, ensure security
and safety (though this seems to be people-focused only);
ensure medical care accessible; start schools at least for the
youngest children.
? Move people who are in the settlements in the worst
geographies for flooding or practical reasons/ other
reasons (e.g., the one currently with 4000 people on the prime
minister's lawn) to pre-constructed tent settlements
elsewhere - they have built the first of these already with INGO
Shelter Box though apparently the tents were put up too close
to one another
• Areas lacking in mention when I heard the above
discussed: a solution to ensure people have somewhere to go
when the heavy rains come; ensure continuity of key services
once the rains come; a solution to ensure people are paid how
to ensure sufficient light in the camps, clearly critical to
security (rapes are skyrocketing and I know there were at least
2 murders in one camp on Saturday night); what the right spec
of tent is for any of the above - housing, clinic, evacuation,
school and what could be multipurpose; plan for older
children/young adults who may be too old for initial school
plan; how to best support / help create where needed
settlement governance; how to census, on a semi-regular basis,
who is in the settlements
® Over next 6-12 months:
o Assess which homes are sufficiently safe for families
to return to and subsequently encourage them to do
so; government estimates this will be —30% of all
homes/families (though this seems to be a guess, i.e., no
evidence base)
• Build semi-permanent settlements or augment pre-
existing villages around Port Au Prince where
feasible to enable the government to move people

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05774208 Date: 08/31/2015
out of settlements to those sites. End goal is to move
400-1000 families to each of these as needed
o Longer-term:
• Rebuilt Port Au Prince though it is unclear how/if/why people
would move back or what the government's post-rebuild
vision looks like
? Build more robust health, education etc systems than existed
before the earthquake
? *Clearly this is the less well-defined part of the ""plan""
Context
I spent the last four days in Haiti. I was with Paul Farmer (Paul) and Partners in
Health (PIH) the entire time - in Port Au Prince Thursday, Friday and Sunday
afternoon and at PIH sites in Laconville and Cange, in the Central Plateau region
Saturday and Sunday morning. I sat in on Paul's formal meetings in Port Au Prince
with: the Haitian Minister of Health Alex Larsen and his team; the Haitian
government official ostensibly overseeing the reconstruction efforts/ UN liaison
Leslie Voltaire; a x-UN group preparing for the PDNA (post disaster needs
assessment) conference in New York at the end of March working on giving 'voice to
the voiceless,' i.e., the designated 15minutes at the conference to highlight the voices
of those most affected (the 15 minutes I gather are happening at all only because of
Cheryl and Paul), UNDP, UNHCR and others were represented; a group interested in
building a logistics center for the reconstruction efforts, i.e., outside the UN ambit,
including people from Royal Caribbean, McKinsey and the people we were traveling
with, including Wes Edens, CEO of Fortress and a supporter of PIH - and the person
who donated, and continues to donate the space at the Miami airport that PIH,
Clinton Foundation, University of Miami Medical Center and others are using to
move goods by air and sea, via transfer, to Haiti. Informally, I talked with: people in
settlements and settlement committee heads, through a translator; local Haitian
doctors; ex-pat PIH and other doctors in mobile clinics in settlements; doctors,
nurses and US police officers I ran into on the street, at dinner, at their ad hoc
residence in the abandoned Aristide Foundation; Maryse Kedar who hosted us our
nights in Port Au Prince, a member of the local elite, and her ad hoc Israel volunteers
(from the Israeli Agency for International Development Cooperation, ie their USAID,
as mentioned above); a broad swath of people serving on the USNS Comfort, both on
and off the ship; US Army enlisted and officers whenever I saw them; Louise Ivers,
head of PIH in Haiti, and others we met or ran into along the way.

American Diplomacy Revealed as Good
By ROGER COHEN
NEW YORK — Let's hear it for the men and women of the U.S. Foreign Service!
They are, to judge from the WikiLeaks dump of a quarter-million of their private or secret cables, thoughtful, well-informed
and dedicated servants of the American interest who write clear, declarative English sentences.
I've not heard much in the torrent of Wiki-chatter about these admirable career diplomats whose diplomacy is now
condemned to be unquiet. Yet it is they whose lives have been upturned. Every journalist knows that if their
correspondence over several years was suddenly made public, they would lose most of their sources. That should give
every journalist pause.
So it will be on the front line of U.S. diplomacy. Contacts will self-censor. They will go quiet, particularly in the more
conspiratorial parts of the world which also tend to be the most unstable, like the Middle East. Layers of secrecy will be
added.
Julian Assange, the thin-skinned founder of WikiLeaks, has hurt U.S. interests across a broad but probably shallow
spectrum. That will satisfy him in that he's a self-styled foe of the United States. The guy makes me queasy.
Perhaps the most shocking thing about the Assange treasure trove — beyond the ""shock"" of venal Gulf Arab Sunni
leaders looking for war on the cheap against Shiite Iran so long as it doesn't disrupt their U.S.-armed fiefdoms; or the
""shock"" of Pakistani double-dealing and nuclear procrastination; or the ""shock"" of yet more premature Israeli predictions
on when Iran will have a nuclear weapon; or the ""shock"" of continued Saudi funding of Al Qaeda; or the ""shock"" of the
Chinese Politburo hacking into Google; or the ""shock"" of Muammar el-Qaddafi's taste for voluptuous Slavic women and
Silvio Berlusconi's taste for all women — perhaps the biggest shock of all is just how professional, sober and short on
embarrassment all these cables are and just how much they conform with the world as we already knew it, right down to
the familiar adjectives evoking French President Nicolas Sarkozy: ""hyperactive,"" ""mercurial,"" ""authoritarian,"" ""erratic,""
""monarch-like.""
I swear, if they hadn't become diplomats a lot of these State Department people could have become good hacks.
Overall, my longstanding admiration for America's conscientious diplomats has been redoubled, not least for this
underreported nugget on the turbulent Iranian election of 2009, contained in a cable of Jan. 12, 2010, from Dubai: ""While
we don't know nor might not ever know the real June 12 vote count, it is clear that the turnout was at record high levels
and that there was systematic vote count fraud (if in fact the votes were even counted) to ensure that Ahmadinejad 'won
big' in the first round.""
It is good to know that this is the innermost conviction of American diplomacy: the fraud was evident to anyone in Tehran
during the election and its violent aftermath.
A couple more observations on Iran: The first is that the Sunni autocrats of the Gulf are as exercised as they are about
Tehran in part because they know that any U.S.-Iranian breakthrough might make them more dispensable to the United
States. Their vested interest in the prevailing Middle Eastern strategic equation is strong; nothing would redraw the Middle
East more than overcoming the U.S.-Iranian psychosis.
The second is that President Barack Obama's approach to Iran has been much more conventional than his initial outreach
suggested. Old habits of attempted coercion trumped originality. Very quickly he fell back on Dennis Ross's tired thinking
about balancing ""appetizing carrots"" with ""sharp sticks"" in tackling Iran's nuclear program.
The cables reveal that as early as March 2009, a senior U.S. diplomat was talking ""dual track,"" telling Europeans that
""engagement alone is unlikely to succeed"" and calling for added ""pressure."" Perhaps Iranian skepticism could never have
been overcome; certainly this approach guaranteed longstanding Iranian grievances would fester.
Assange himself clearly understands nothing of Iran or the Middle East or diplomacy. In an interview with Time, he
expressed approval for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ""coming out with a very interesting statement that
leaders should speak in public like they do in private whenever they can"" and bought into Netanyahu's view that this, in
Assange's words, would ""lead to some kind of increase in the peace process in the Middle East and particularly in relation
to Iran.
It
Huh? Netanyahu was referring to Arab leaders' now-documented private calls for a U.S.-led war against Iran, an option he
also favors. And that, for Assange, is a step forward to peace! He's all over the place.
What should we make of this brainy naïf who told my colleague John Burns that America is a threat to democracy? He's a
loose canon; let him be. My impression is he's self-armed with a spade and he's digging.
And what of the messenger's message? The cables are intriguing, offering plenty of voyeuristic titillation but no gasp of
discovery. They provide texture but break little new ground. Yet their publication has done significant damage to the
courageous work of America's diplomats and may endanger lives. That's a tradeoff that I find troubling and unpersuasive.","UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05776654 Date: 08/31/2015

Line block questions:
Whv is the Julia Roberts interview during the time I have weekly depoartmental meeting?
Also, I don't see a mtg w POTUS on the 15th--can we get that scheduled?
T want to have my own pre-brief before the Kissinger event.
And. I notice that the HBO event conflicts w a PC mtg at NH. Now w/Doniion in charge can
we get a set time for all the regular mtgs so we don't schedule conflicting events?
When is Adm Mullen having his small Pakistan dinner? if it's the 21st, can I get back in
time from Paris?
If La Raze can pay for a reception for Raul, why is his swearing in ceremony in the
Treaty Room instead of the Franklin? Can't we find a time for them? Also, I won't be able
to go to his reception at a hotel since I have to go to the screening for the Nat Geo
special so that day doesn't work so well. What about on the 26th after T get back from NY
since gill will be in Haiti and could come back to DC?

The Crossroads Nation
By DAVID BROOKS
Bill Clinton used to talk about building a bridge to the 21st century. President Obama talks about laying down a ""new foundation."" But
Clinton was always vague about what the land on the other side of that bridge was going to look like, and Obama is vague about what
edifice is going to go on top of that foundation.
They are vague because nobody is clear about what sort of country America is going to be in 2030 or 2050. Nobody has quite defined
America's coming economic identity.
In thinking about this question, it probably helps to start at the beginning. Five hundred years ago, agriculture was the major economic
activity. One hundred years ago, it was industrial production. Now, of course, we're living in an information age. Innovation and
creativity are the engines of economic growth.
Howard Gardner of Harvard once put together a composite picture of the extraordinarily creative person: She comes from a little place
somewhat removed from the center of power and influence. As an adolescent, she feels herself outgrowing her own small circle. She
moves to a metropolis and finds a group of people who share her passions and interests. She gets involved with a team to create
something amazing.
Then, at some point, she finds her own problem, which is related to and yet different from the problems that concern others in her
group. She breaks off and struggles and finally emerges with some new thing. She brings it back to her circle. It is tested, refined and
improved.
The main point in this composite story is that creativity is not a solitary process. It happens within networks. It happens when talented
people get together, when idea systems and mentalities merge.
Now imagine you are this creative person in the year 2010, 2025 or 2050. You are living in some small town in Ukraine or Kenya or
some other place, foreign or domestic. You long to break out and go to a place where people are gathering to think about the things you
are thinking about, creating the things you want to create.
If you are passionate about fashion, maybe you will go to Paris. If it's engineering, maybe it'll be Germany. But if you are passionate
about many other spheres, I suspect you'll want to be in America.
You'll want to be in the U.S. because English has become the global language. You'll want to come because American universities lead
the world in research and draw many of the best minds from all corners of the earth.
You'll want to be there because American institutions are relatively free from corruption. Intellectual property is protected. Huge
venture capital funds already exist.
Moreover, the United States is a universal nation. There are already people there with connections all over the world. A nation of
immigrants is more permeable than say, Chinese society.
You also observe that America hosts the right kind of networks — ones that are flexible and intense. Study after study suggests that
America is one of those societies with high social trust. Americans build large, efficient organizations that are not bound by the circles of
kinship and clan. Study after study finds that Americans are not hierarchical. American children are raised to challenge their parents.
American underlings are relatively free to challenge their bosses. In this country you're less likely to have to submit to authority.
From this story you can see that economic power in the 21st century is not going to look like economic power in the 20th century. The
crucial fact about the new epoch is that creativity needs hubs. Information networks need junction points. The nation that can make
itself the crossroads to the world will have tremendous economic and political power.
In 2009, Anne-Marie Slaughter, now director of policy planning at the State Department, wrote an essay for Foreign Affairs in which
she laid out the logic of this new situation: ""In a networked world, the issue is no longer relative power, but centrality in an increasingly
dense global web.""
Slaughter's essay was titled ""America's Edge."" That is apt. Americans are now in a depressed state of mind. As China and India rise,
nearly two-thirds of Americans believe their nation is in decline.
In fact, the U.S. is well situated to be the crossroads nation. It is well situated to be the center of global networks and to nurture the right
kinds of networks. Building that America means doing everything possible to thicken connections: finance research to attract scientists;
improve infrastructure to ease travel; fix immigration to funnel talent; reform taxes to attract superstars; make study abroad a rite of
passage for college students; take advantage of the millions of veterans who have served overseas.
The nation with the thickest and most expansive networks will define the age. There's no reason to be pessimistic about that.","UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05772864 Date: 08/31/2015

Subject: (AP) Israeli official: Hamas rockets can reach Tel Aviv
TEL AVIV (AP) — A senior Israeli intelligence official says llamas has rockets with a range of 50 miles, putting the coastal
metropolis of Tel Aviv within range of its launchers. The official blames Egypt, saying it is not doing enough to stem
smuggling through a network of tunnels along the relatively short border between its Sinai desert and the Gaza
Strip. The official said most of the tunnels were concentrated in an area no longer than 2.5 miles. ""Egypt can stop all
this smuggling of weapons within 24 hours if they want to do it,"" the official said November 14, speaking on condition of
anonymity under Israeli security regulations. The official said, however, that intelligence cooperation with Egypt was
otherwise effective.

Northern Ireland agrees power-sharing deal
Gordon Brown hails historic deal which will see justice and policing powers be devolved to Stormont from 12 April

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773264 Date: 08/31/2015
Justice and policing powers will be devolved to Northern Ireland <http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/northernireland>'s
power-sharing government from 12 April in a historic deal agreed by the main parties that ""opens a new chapter"" after
decades of violence, Gordon Brown said today.
Standing alongside his Irish counterpart, Brian Cowen, at a press conference at Hillsborough Castle outside Belfast, the
prime minister said the ""inspirational"" agreement between Sinn Fein <http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/sinn-fein>
and the Democratic Unionist party (DUP) <http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/dup> was a foundation for lasting peace.
The deal — finally agreed to by the DUP <http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2010/feb/05/northern-ireland-dup-ulster-
deal> last night and described as a final piece in the jigsaw after a long search for peace — comes after two weeks of
round-the-clock negotiations and brings an end to fears that the power-sharing government might collapse.
It will see policing and justice powers devolved from Westminster to the assembly within weeks and includes new plans
on overseeing parades.
Brown, who travelled to Belfast this morning, said the agreement had been possible because of ""a new spirit of mutual
co-operation and respect"".
The deal meets a key Sinn Fein demand and prevents the republican party from walking out of the power-sharing
executive. In return, the DUP has secured reforms to the way loyalist marches are handled in Northern Ireland, including
the abolition of the Parades Commission, a body most unionists regard as biased in favour of nationalists.
A cross-community vote will now be held in the Stormont assembly on 9 March before the policing and justice powers
are devolved from London on 12 April.
Brown told reporters: ""The achievements have been as great as they are inspirational. This moment and this agreement
belongs to the people of Northern Ireland, all of the people, and now more than ever before so does their future ... This
is the last chapter of a long and troubled story and the beginning of a new chapter after decades of violence, years of
talks, weeks of stalemate.""
Cowen praised both unionists and nationalists for making ""fair and balanced compromises"" to bridge the divisions and
said the quality of the negotiations meant that the ""devolved institutions can and will work"".
The Northern Ireland secretary, Shaun Woodward, said the deal would further isolate republican dissidents who have
launched three separate gun and bomb attacks against police stations in the province over the last 10 days. The deal
would ""absolutely"" make Northern Ireland a safer place, he said.
The DUP leader, Peter Robinson, said the agreement ""will be more enduring because of the time spent"" in forming it.
Referring back to the Belfast Agreement of 1998 <http://www.nio.gov.uk/the-agreement> when negotiations bore fruit
at the 11th hour, the Sinn Fein president, Gerry Adams, described the current deal and the rescue of power-sharing as
""yet another very good Friday"".
Jeffrey Donaldson told the Guardian the DUP's 36-strong assembly team was now unanimously in favour of the deal.
But the Ulster Unionist party (UUP) has yet to officially back the package which will allow the assembly to set up
legislation to change the way parades are judged.
A UUP spokeswoman said members wanted to see the proposed agreement before giving their response to the two
governments. ""We have not had sight of this agreement and until we do we will not be signing up to it,"" she said.
The talks, which centred on Hillsborough Castle, outside Belfast, are the longest set of continuous negotiations held in
the near 20-year peace process. Sinn Fein had accused the DUP of stalling on the transfer of policing powers for the last
three years and it was feared that failure to find agreement could see the collapse of the power-sharing government led
by the two parties.
The agreement finally came near midnight at Stormont's parliament building. Earlier in the evening Sinn Fein had said
the basis of a deal was on the table and it was giving the DUP leadership the time to persuade its party to accept it.
Robinson emerged from a meeting of party colleagues to confirm that he had secured unanimous support for the
proposals. Earlier in the week up to 14 DUP assembly members had opposed a proposed deal because it did not give
unionists enough concessions.
Robinson said he would now look to gain the support of the community and the smaller assembly parties for the deal.
""We have a basis upon which we can go forward and recommend it [the deal] to our party, to the other parties in
Northern Ireland and to the community.
""An essential element of the Democratic Unionist Party's manifesto is the requirement for community confidence; we
believe this can be the basis for gaining that confidence.""
However the leader of the hardline Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV), Jim Allister, questioned why the 14 DUP rebels had
changed their minds.

""The deal hasn't changed, only the snowmen of the DUP, who melted once the heat came on,"" Allister said.
The DUP now faces a struggle to ward off the TUV threat in the forthcoming general election. Allister will portray the
deal as a sell-out of unionist principles and a sop to republicanism.

. Re: Sunday, State of Play
Clegg is still in talks with Cameron. About 1,500 Liberal Democrats spontaneously protested at Lib-Dem headquarters
against a deal with the Tories given their policies, especially on Europe. But Clegg remains in negotiations. He seems
quite intent on working it out with Cameron, it appears. His inner Tory magnetically draws him to his heritage. Clegg has
also misplayed almost every turn, presented with big chances and blowing them through a combination of inexperience
(derived partly from heading a party out of power for nearly 100 years) and inbred arrogance (from no less a privileged
background than Cameron, though seeming less snobbish because he went to Westminster instead of Eton and has a
less pronounced upper-class accent, more neutral, because of his more cosmopolitan roots through his family).
What about Labour? Shaun and a couple of others have rounded up about 29 votes from other parties (Scottish National
Party, NI parties, Welsh party) that could be part of a grand progressive once-in-a-lifetime coalition that required the
LDs. Gordon has said he will allow Clegg-Cameron discussions to play out and a general offer to Clegg is on the table, its
terms giving far more on a referendum and policy than the Tories. Behind the scenes, Labour is putting whatever harsh
pressure it can on LD leaders. Peter is playing a cynical double game. He is a sectarian in a sect of one. Yet Gordon for
strange psychological reasons rooted in his triangle with Tony and Peter relies on Peter. Peter, according to Shaun, has
wrung a pledge from Borwn that if Brown emerges from this crisis he, Peter, will replace David as Foreign Secretary.
Meanwhile, Peter has advised David to sideline himself. David has done so instead of being forward as a strong party
man behind Brown in dire straits. Standing back only makes David look ambitious, waiting for Brown to lose and aiming
to a leadership contest afterward, when Peter, as he has promised, would guide David to the prize. The plot thickens: Ed

Miliband, David's younger brother, the environment secretary, will run for leader against his brother if Brown loses. Ed
has more of a common touch. The outcome of that contest would be more than uncertain. But before that eventuality
Gordon's team reaches out to the LDs in private. Yet Shaun's attitude, as I read it, leans toward pessmism. A London
Times polls just out says 62 percent want Gordon out. Where were the fickle voters in the election? The poll shows more
than discontent with Gordon, but also how people are being whipped by the Murdoch media.
What about the Tories? A secret memo from William Hague to Cameron written before the election was leaked this
morning to The Observer (the Sunday paper of The Guardian), proposes an anti-Europe line of the new government.
(I've enclosed the article below.) The atmosphere inside the Conservatives is acrid and anxious. But Lord Ashcroft, the
Tory moneyman, who spent five million pounds alone in marginal districts, is furious that Cameron failed to win outright,
failed in his campaign, made a foolish decision to include Clegg in the debates, etc. Many agree with the evil Ashcroft.
But the finger pointing won't matter if a deal works with Clegg. The Conservative strategy would be to coopt Clegg now,
do whatever deal can be done, maintain a more or less center-right but moderated government for about a year, call a
new election, win outright on the momentum of the recovery engineered by Brown but claimed by Tories as proof that
the change was responsible, jettison Clegg and the LDs, and govern from the radical right as the children of Thatcher for
five years. The Tories would then move on their electoral reforms: cutting the number of seats in Parliament,
redistricting in Conservative favor, and trying to outlaw union contributions to the Labour Party.
What about the LDs? Clegg's deal with the Tories would of course thwart any Lib-Lab coalition, probably the only chance
for a grand progressive alliance that would keep the Tories out of power forever. Clegg's personal instincts obviously
lean toward the Tories, having little to do with policy. The party's leaders may be opposed, but they are also likely to be
feckless and weak as they always have been.
So, whatever the case, I would doubt you'll see David again as Foreign Secretary. Prepare for hauge, who is deeply anti-
European and will be disingenuous with you. Tory budget cuts in NI, already announced, would cause havoc with peace
and economic recovery. I'd send a private message asap on that score the second a new government is announced, if it
is. Tilt publicly to Merkel on Europe for this reason among others.

Tory-Lib Dem coalition threatened by secret hardline memo on Europe • Draft letter by William Hague sets out tough
stance on EU • Leak follows leaders""constructive, amicable' meeting Toby Helm
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/tobyhelm> and Anushka Asthana
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/anushkaasthana>
The Observer <http://observerguardian.co.uk> , Sunday 9 May 2010
David Cameron <http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/davidcameron> 's hopes of forming a coalition with the Liberal
Democrats <http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/Iiberaldemocrats> were dramatically undermined last night by the
leaking of a top-secret letter outlining the hardline Eurosceptic stance he and William Hague
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/williamhague> planned to adopt in government.
The document, obtained by the Observer, is headed ""draft letter from Foreign Secretary to Prime Minister"" and was
written last week. It assumed an outright Tory victory and spelt out how Hague intended to adopt a tough approach to
Europe at a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Brussels tomorrow.
In the letter, compiled by civil servants but written in the first person, Hague tells Cameron how his message would be
that ""the British relationship with the EU has changed with our election"" to one firmly against any further integration.
Exposing the massive gulf between Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg <http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/nickclegg>
and the Conservative leadership on Europe, Hague says he would demand the right to repatriate powers over criminal
justice as well as social and employment policy during the first term of a Tory government — demands many EU leaders
say they would resist.
Hague planned to tell his EU counterparts: ""Rest assured that we seek engagement, not confrontation. But our aim is to
achieve these commitments during this parliament."" He would also tell his first foreign ministers' meeting ""we will never
join the euro"" and conclude: ""You will find us firm but fair, playing a leading role, fighting our corner, practical and
straight-talking.""

Last night the Tories said they had no knowledge of the letter. But the Observer understands it was drawn up on the
basis of detailed briefings between senior civil servants and Hague. The document came to light as Clegg, a strong pro-
European, yesterday met his MPs and senior party figures to discuss a possible coalition with the Tories, who emerged
from Thursday's general election with the largest number of seats but short of an overall majority.
Cameron and Clegg held face-to-face talks late yesterday as they continued their attempts to thrash out a power-sharing
deal. A senior Conservative party spokeswoman said the talks were ""constructive and amicable"". The 70-minute meeting
took place at Admiralty House in Whitehall. A Lib Dem spokesman also described the discussions as ""constructive and
amicable"".
Tory and Lib Dem sources said last night that discussions would not conclude until the beginning of the coming week at
the earliest. An emergency meeting of the 1922 committee of Tory backbenchers will be held tomorrow to discuss the
possible coalition. Today, Hague, Oliver Letwin <http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/oliverletwin> and George Osborne
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/georgeosborne> will resume talks with the Lib Dems' Vince Cable, Chris Huhne
and David Laws.
But the stark language used in the letter is bound to alarm Clegg, who has been savage in his criticism of the
Conservatives <http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/conservatives>' attitude to Europe which he believes is rooted in
the past and will limit Britain's ability to fight cross-border crime and meet the environmental challenges of the 21st
century.
The document will also be seen by Lib Dem MPs and the party's rank and file as evidence that their pro-Europeanism
would be compromised by linking up with the Tories. A Lib Dem spokesman said the party was strongly pro-European,
but would not be drawn on the document.
Yesterday Cameron came under pressure from senior figures in his own party not to give in to Clegg's demands by
watering down Conservative manifesto commitments. Shadow defence secretary Liam Fox warned that a Tory
government could not be ""held to ransom"" by Lib Dems demanding proportional representation.
Clegg may also face opposition from within his party to any attempt to form a coalition with the Tories, particularly on
economic issues.
Yesterday the Social Liberal Forum, which represents left-leaning Lib Dems and includes a third of the party's MPs,
issued a set of ""red lines"" which it said the party must not cross, including any measure that would increase the gap
between the rich and poor— ruling out supporting the Tory pledge to cut inheritance tax. Three other red lines were any
suggestion of cuts to frontline services in the current financial year, any worsening treatment of asylum seekers and any
watering-down of the human rights act.
Meanwhile, Gordon Brown and his closest advisers were working on how to expand their counter-offer to the Lib Dems,
including a referendum on changes to the voting system. Senior officials said Labour was planning to draw up a formal
""coalition contract"" — as happens in Germany — that would bind the Lib Dems and other smaller parties into a deal if the
Tory discussions with the Lib Dems were to fail.
Most Labour ministers now believe Brown would have to step down before Clegg would consider a pact, though senior
government insiders insisted this was not being discussed as an option.
One re-elected Labour MP, John Mann, of Bassetlaw, called on Brown to step down as Labour leader, claiming that the
party would have influence on the outcome of the current negotiations only if Brown agreed to give up the leadership.
""Brown should not lead Labour into any future election and he should stand down before the next Labour party
conference,"" he said. ""Gordon Brown's continuation as leader rules out the credibility of a Lib-Lab pact that has to
prioritise the modernisation and reform of the antiquated UK political systems.""

On UK: Clegg held his own in the second debate last night. Gordon hit him as ""anti-American."" This feels like it's moving
to a hung parliament. Cameron can't break through. Two-thirds of the voters simply hate the Tories. No matter how well
Clegg does the system doesn't allow for any gain in seats to match his personal poll numbers. UK stunned by its first
series of debates and the whole campaign has atrophied in wonderment, little happening between the debates. Final

A few comments from one of my staff members who has long experience with
the Middle East follow.
From Martin: The principle conclusion from a quick visit to Israel and Ramallah over the weekend is that
Netanyahu is in a strong position politically, with an unusually stable ruling coalition. Nobody I spoke with
believed that the government would have fallen if he had decided to extend the settlement freeze before its
expiry, as a gesture to U.S. peacemaking efforts. In their view, he could have easily garnered the support of a
large majority of the people, for whom the settlers are a marginal concern. And this would have given him
leverage over his ministers to ensure their support or abstention in the cabinet. As Dan Meridor noted, Likud
voters are to the left of their Knesset members when it comes to peacemaking (70 percent support the two-state
solution, vs only 50 percent of the leadership).
Lieberman, not the Likud, is Bibi's chief concern. He wants to keep him in the government for as long as
possible for fear that when he leaves he will garner the support of those on the right, including from the Likud,
who oppose peacemaking. For the time being, Bibi uses the threat of an alternative coalition with Kadima to
keep Lieberman in the tent. But the clock is ticking. According to Tzipi Livni, she can bring her party into the
government now, and is willing to do so without any demand for ""rotation,"" provided Bibi is serious about
negotiating peace. But as the elections grow closer, more and more of her party members are turning against
the idea of joining the government. They are strengthened in their views by recent internal polling which shows
Kadima with 32 seats (up from 28 now), Likud slightly down at 25, and Labor at only 5.
Therefore, if Bibi intends to make a deal with Abu Mazen, he will need to do so sooner rather than later. The
longer he waits, the less leverage he has on Lieberman and the more likely Lieberman will break away to
oppose him in the next elections.
In this context, Bibi's negotiating tactics become self-defeating. Believing that he is a great negotiator, and that
he is operating in the Middle East bazaar, he inflates his requirements well beyond anything reasonable in the
belief that this is the best way to secure the highest price. The process of bringing him down to a reasonable
price uses up a lot of energy, uses up a lot of goodwill, humiliates his Palestinian negotiating partner, and raises
doubts about his seriousness. In the end, under great pressure from all quarters, he will make the final
concession, but only after wasting a lot of time, making everybody furious with him, and thereby securing no
credit either with his supporters or negotiating partners. At heart, he seems to lack a generosity of spirit. This
combines with his legendary fear of being seen as a ""freier"" (sucker) in front of his people to create a real
problem in the negotiations, especially because he holds most of the cards.
This is further complicated by his introduction of the notion of ""creative ideas."" Thinking out of the box, as he
likes to do, will only further delay the negotiations because the box is already well-defined. To attempt to
broaden the parameters will generate mistrust of his intentions on the Palestinian side just when direct
negotiations provide the opportunity to build trust.
The reason for dwelling on Bibi's psychology rather than his politics is that the latter all point in the direction of
making a deal: the Israeli public is ready to get on with it; if Israel doesn't make a serious move, it will further
delegitimize its standing internationally (something Bibi is deeply concerned about); Bibi needs President
Obama in his corner to deal with the threat from Iran and to avoid punishment by the voters for mishandling
relations with the U.S.; and if he doesn't make the deal with Abu Mazen now, he will have helped to advance
the future he is most concerned about - a llamas takeover of the Palestinian leadership.
Yuval Diskin was quite clear about this latter point. After praising the Palestinian security services to the sky
(unusual for him) he told me that he had warned Bibi that at the moment they have a high motivation to prevent
terror because they believe they are building their state. If that proves to be an illusion, the motivation will
disappear and then he cannot guarantee security in the West Bank. He considers it quite possible that if Bibi
doesn't quickly demonstrate his seriousness to Abu Mazen, he will resign because his honor has now been
seriously damaged. He told Bibi that he cannot predict who will lead the Palestinians if Abu Mazen resigns, but
that Salam Fayyad will likely have to go too.
What is to be done? I have no magic solution for what must be a deeply frustrating exercise for you. And

Bibi. But you should avoid any kind of finger-pointing in favor of a repeated commitment to a negotiated
solution and a willingness to engage with both sides in trying to make that happen, when they're ready. The
Israeli public and the American Jewish Community should know how far the President was prepared to go and

Subject: Martin Indyk sent this to Jeff Feltman -- very interesting analysis
Jake probably passed this on to you, but just in case, I think it's definitely worth reading
A few comments from one of my staff members who has long experience with
the Middle East follow.
From Martin: The principle conclusion from a quick visit to Israel and Ramallah over the weekend is that
Netanyahu is in a strong position politically, with an unusually stable ruling coalition. Nobody I spoke with
believed that the government would have fallen if he had decided to extend the settlement freeze before its
expiry, as a gesture to U.S. peacemaking efforts. In their view, he could have easily garnered the support of a
large majority of the people, for whom the settlers are a marginal concern. And this would have given him
leverage over his ministers to ensure their support or abstention in the cabinet. As Dan Meridor noted, Likud
voters are to the left of their Knesset members when it comes to peacemaking (70 percent support the two-state
solution, vs only 50 percent of the leadership).
Lieberman, not the Likud, is Bibi's chief concern. He wants to keep him in the government for as long as
possible for fear that when he leaves he will garner the support of those on the right, including from the Likud,
who oppose peacemaking. For the time being, Bibi uses the threat of an alternative coalition with Kadima to
keep Lieberman in the tent. But the clock is ticking. According to Tzipi Livni, she can bring her party into the
government now, and is willing to do so without any demand for ""rotation,"" provided Bibi is serious about
negotiating peace. But as the elections grow closer, more and more of her party members are turning against
the idea of joining the government. They are strengthened in their views by recent internal polling which shows
Kadima with 32 seats (up from 28 now), Likud slightly down at 25, and Labor at only 5.
Therefore, if Bibi intends to make a deal with Abu Mazen, he will need to do so sooner rather than later. The
longer he waits, the less leverage he has on Lieberman and the more likely Lieberman will break away to
oppose him in the next elections.
In this context, Bibi's negotiating tactics become self-defeating. Believing that he is a great negotiator, and that
he is operating in the Middle East bazaar, he inflates his requirements well beyond anything reasonable in the
belief that this is the best way to secure the highest price. The process of bringing him down to a reasonable
price uses up a lot of energy, uses up a lot of goodwill, humiliates his Palestinian negotiating partner, and raises
doubts about his seriousness. In the end, under great pressure from all quarters, he will make the final
concession, but only after wasting a lot of time, making everybody furious with him, and thereby securing no
credit either with his supporters or negotiating partners. At heart, he seems to lack a generosity of spirit. This
combines with his legendary fear of being seen as a ""freier"" (sucker) in front of his people to create a real
problem in the negotiations, especially because he holds most of the cards.
This is further complicated by his introduction of the notion of ""creative ideas."" Thinking out of the box, as he
likes to do, will only further delay the negotiations because the box is already well-defined. To attempt to
broaden the parameters will generate mistrust of his intentions on the Palestinian side just when direct
negotiations provide the opportunity to build trust.

The reason for dwelling on Bibi's psychology rather than his politics is that the latter all point in the direction of
making a deal: the Israeli public is ready to get on with it; if Israel doesn't make a serious move, it will further
delegitimize its standing internationally (something Bibi is deeply concerned about); Bibi needs President
Obama in his corner to deal with the threat from Iran and to avoid punishment by the voters for mishandling
relations with the U.S.; and if he doesn't make the deal with Abu Mazen now, he will have helped to advance
the future he is most concerned about - a llamas takeover of the Palestinian leadership.
Yuval Diskin was quite clear about this latter point. After praising the Palestinian security services to the sky
(unusual for him) he told me that he had warned Bibi that at the moment they have a high motivation to prevent
terror because they believe they are building their state. If that proves to be an illusion, the motivation will
disappear and then he cannot guarantee security in the West Bank. He considers it quite possible that if Bibi
doesn't quickly demonstrate his seriousness to Abu Mazen, he will resign because his honor has now been
seriously damaged. He told Bibi that he cannot predict who will lead the Palestinians if Abu Mazen resigns, but
that Salam Fayyad will likely have to go too.
What is to be done? I have no magic solution for what must be a deeply frustrating exercise for you. And
please forgive me if what I recommend here is just repeating what you already know.

Subject: (Reuters) Afghans say two students killed by NATO troops
KABUL (Reuters) - Afghan officials accused NATO-led troops of killing two school boys in central Afghanistan on October
23 after a patrol came under fire by Taliban insurgents, but foreign troops said the circumstances were unclear.
A statement released by the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) said two civilians had possibly
been killed in the Maidan Shahr district of Wardak province, west of Kabul, when insurgents attacked the patrol.
""During the attack, three Afghan citizens on a motorcycle entered the engagement area. Two of them fell off the
vehicle and were taken away by local villagers,"" ISAF said.
It said their condition could not be determined before they were taken away. The incident was under investigation,
ISAF said.
However, a spokesman for the Wardak governor said ISAF troops had fired indiscriminately and killed two students
about 30 miles west of Kabul when a rocket was fired at their convoy. He said the rocket was apparently fired by the
Taliban.
Wardak police chief Nawas Haqyar said ISAF troops were returning fire and mistakenly killed the students. The attack
prompted a brief demonstration by angry villagers, demanding an explanation from NATO forces over the killing.

The Political Scene
Confounding Fathers
The Tea Party's Cold War roots.
by Sean Wilentz October 18, 2010
ann Beck's view of American history stems from the paranoid politics of the fifties.
A few months ago, the cable-television and radio host Glenn Beck began his Fox News show with one of his favorite
props: a pipe clenched between his teeth. ""I've got my pipe,"" he told his audience, his speech slightly muddled by the
stem, ""because we're going to speak about schoolish kind of things."" The theme of the day was ""Restoring History,"" and
Beck, looking professorial in a neat dark blazer and a pink button-down shirt, began the lesson by peering at a stack of
history textbooks and pronouncing them full of falsehoods, produced by ""malicious progressive intent."" Progressives, he
explained—liberals, socialists, Communists, the entire spectrum of the left—""knew they had to separate us from our
history to be able to separate us from our Constitution and God."" For the next hour, Beck earnestly explained some of the
history that ""is being stolen from us"": the depression of 1920, for example, or how conservative economics saved the
nation from the ""near-depression"" of 1946—crises that progressives don't want you to know about. ""You've been taught
one lie, I think, your whole life,"" he said.
For the fractious Tea Party movement, Beck—a former drive-time radio jockey, a recovering alcoholic, and a Mormon
convert—has emerged as both a unifying figure and an intellectual guide. One opinion poll, released in July by
Democracy Corps, showed that he is ""the most highly regarded individual among Tea Party supporters,"" seen not merely
as an entertainer, like Rush Limbaugh, but as an ""educator."" And in the past few months Beck has established his own
institute of learning: the online, for-profit Beck University. Enrollees can take courses like Faith 102, which contends with
""revisionists and secular progressives"" about the separation of church and state; Hope 102, an attack on the activist
federal government; and the combined Charity 101/102/103, a highly restrictive interpretation of rights, federalism, and the
division of powers.
During the ""Restoring History"" episode, Beck twice encouraged viewers to join his Web seminars, where they can hear
""lessons from the best and brightest historians and scholars that we could find."" The B.U. faculty consists of three
members, including one bona-fide academic, James R. Stoner, Jr., the chair of the political-science department at
Louisiana State University; the other two are the head of a management consulting firm and the founder of WallBuilders,
which the Web site calls ""a national pro-family organization."" Beck himself often acts as a professor, a slightly jocular one,
on his Fox News program. Surrounded by charts and figures, he offers explanations of current politics and history lessons
about the country's long march to Obama-era totalitarianism. The decline, he says, began with the Progressive era of the
early twentieth century, in particular with the Presidency of Woodrow Wilson, when both the Federal Reserve System and
the graduated federal income tax came into existence. ""Wilson,"" Beck told his radio audience in August, ""just despised
what America was.""
Beck's claims have found an audience among Tea Party spokesmen and sympathizers. At the movement's Freedom
Summit in Washington last September, one activist told a reporter, ""The election between Teddy Roosevelt and Woodrow
Wilson in 1912 was when it started going downhill."" And in April an angry member of the Tea Party Patriots group from
Cape Fear, North Carolina, claimed on the group's Web site that ""the very things you see happening in this country today
started with the Wilson Administration.""
At a Tax Day rally this past spring, the veteran conservative organizer Richard Viguerie described the Tea Party as ""an
unfettered new force of the middle class."" And, indeed, calling Obama a socialist in the tradition of Woodrow Wilson is
audacious enough to seem like the marker of a new movement—or, at least, a new twist in the nation's long history of
conspiracy-mongering. In fact, it marks a revival of ideas that circulated on the extremist right half a century ago,
especially in the John Birch Society and among its admirers.
Beck's version of American history relies on lessons from his own acknowledged inspiration, the late right-wing writer W.
Cleon Skousen, and also restates charges made by the Birch Society's founder, Robert Welch. The political universe is,
of course, very different today from what it was during the Cold War. Yet the Birchers' politics and their view of American
history—which focussed more on totalitarian threats at home than on those posed by the Soviet Union and Communist
China—has proved remarkably persistent. The pressing historical question is how extremist ideas held at bay for decades
inside the Republican Party have exploded anew—and why, this time, Party leaders have done virtually nothing to
challenge those ideas, and a great deal to abet them.
The early nineteen-sixties were a turbulent time in American politics, for the right wing in particular. In the South, racist
violence against civil-rights workers was constant, deepening sectional splits in the Democratic Party that would in time
deliver the once solidly Democratic South to the Republicans. Southern elected officials, in support of what they called
""massive resistance"" to civil-rights laws and judicial rulings, resurrected the ideas of nullification and interposition, which
claimed that individual states could void federal laws within their own borders. Others focussed on what they considered a
fearsome Communist menace inside the United States. General Edwin A. Walker caused an enormous stir when he
resigned from the Army in 1961, after President John F. Kennedy's Pentagon reprimanded him for spreading right-wing
propaganda among his troops and accusing prominent American officials of Communist sympathies. Senator Strom
Thurmond, the Dixiecrat from South Carolina, spoke for many on the far right when he declared that various modestly
liberal domestic programs ""fall clearly within the category of socialism.""
The John Birch Society was one of the decade's most controversial right-wing organizations. Founded in 1958 by Robert
Welch, a candy manufacturer from Massachusetts, the society took its name from a Baptist missionary and military-
intelligence officer killed by Communist Chinese forces in 1945, whom Welch called the first American casualty of the
Cold War. The group was founded at a propitious time. After Senator Joseph McCarthy's fall, in 1954, many of McCarthy's
followers felt bereft of a voice, and Welch seemed to speak for them; by the mid-sixties, his society's membership was
estimated to be as high as a hundred thousand. Welch, exploiting fears of what McCarthy had called an ""immense""
domestic conspiracy, declared that the federal government had already fallen into the Communists' clutches. In a tract
titled ""The Politician,"" he attacked President Dwight D. Eisenhower as ""a dedicated, conscious agent of the Communist
conspiracy"" who had been serving the plot ""all of his adult life."" Late in 1961, after the disastrous Bay of Pigs invasion, he
accused the Kennedy Administration of ""helping the Communists everywhere in the world while pretending to do the
opposite.""
Wherever he looked, Welch saw Communist forces manipulating American economic and foreign policy on behalf of
totalitarianism. But within the United States, he believed, the subversion had actually begun years before the Bolshevik
Revolution. Conflating modern liberalism and totalitarianism, Welch described government as ""always and inevitably an
enemy of individual freedom."" Consequently, he charged, the Progressive era, which expanded the federal government's
role in curbing social and economic ills, was a dire period in our history, and Woodrow Wilson ""more than any other one
man started this nation on its present road to totalitarianism.""
In the nineteen-sixties, Welch became convinced that even the Communist movement was but ""a tool of the total
conspiracy."" This master conspiracy, he said, had forerunners in ancient Sparta, and sprang fully to life in the eighteenth
century, in the ""uniformly Satanic creed and program"" of the Bavarian Illuminati. Run by those he called ""the Insiders,"" the
conspiracy resided chiefly in international families of financiers, such as the Rothschilds and the Rockefellers, government
agencies like the Federal Reserve System and the Internal Revenue Service, and nongovernmental organizations like the
Bilderberg Group, the Council on Foreign Relations, and the Trilateral Commission. Since the early twentieth century, they
had done a good deal of their evil work under the guise of humanitarian uplift. ""One broad avenue down which these
conspiratorial forces advance was known as progressive legislation,"" Welch declared in 1966. ""The very same collectivist
theories and demagogic pretenses which had destroyed earlier civilizations were now paraded forth in the disguise of new
and modern concepts.""
In the worst case, Welch believed, military action might be necessary to dislodge the totalitarians. But for the moment a
nonviolent political revolution would suffice. Accordingly, he designed the Birch Society roughly, if not explicitly, on the
Marxist-Leninist model of a vanguard revolutionary party: a series of small cells that would work in secret to agitate the
populace and elect right-thinking candidates to office. ""It isn't numbers we have to worry about,"" Welch wrote, ""but the
courage on the part of our followers to stick their necks out and play rough—the same as the Communists do.""
The ""Founder"" himself would dictate the society's policies, advised by a council of about two dozen businessmen and
professionals, and the local cells would be overseen by unyielding commanders. ""It is the leadership that is most
demanding, most exacting of its followers,"" Welch observed, ""that achieves really dedicated support."" Welch's group
became synonymous with right-wing extremism, earning satirical blasts from critics ranging from the cartoonist Walt Kelly
to the musicians Bob Dylan and Dizzy Gillespie. The trumpeter, whose actual name was John Birks Gillespie, made a
humorous run for the Presidency in 1964, organizing John Birks Societies in twenty-five states.
Still, the most outlandish of the era's right-wing anti-Communists was not Welch but Willard Cleon Skousen. A
transplanted Canadian who served as a Mormon missionary in his teens, Skousen was considered so radical in the early
nineteen-sixties that even J. Edgar Hoover's F.B.I. watched him closely; one 1962 memo in his extensive F.B.I. file noted
that ""during the past year or so, Skousen has affiliated himself with the extreme right-wing 'professional communists' who
are promoting their own anticommunism for obvious financial purposes."" Skousen was himself employed by the F.B.I.,
from 1935 until 1951, much of that time as a special agent working chiefly in administration. These desk jobs, he claimed
implausibly, gave him access to confidential domestic intelligence about Communism. Skousen also maintained that he
had served as Hoover's administrative assistant; Hoover informed inquirers that there was no such position.
Skousen taught for years in the speech and religion departments at Brigham Young University, interrupted by a stint, from
1956 to 1960, as the police chief of Salt Lake City. His time in office was contentious, and after he raided a friendly card
game attended by the city's right-wing mayor, J. Bracken Lee, he was promptly fired. Lee called Skousen ""a master of half
truths"" and said that he ran the police department ""like a Gestapo""; Skousen's supporters placed burning crosses on the
Mayor's lawn.
After losing his police job, Skousen founded a group called the All-American Society, which Time described in 1961 as an
exemplar of the far-right ""ultras."" Although he did not join the Birch Society, Skousen worked with its American Opinion
Speakers' Bureau, and, in 1963, wrote a rousing tract titled ""The Communist Attack on the John Birch Society,"" which
condemned the society's critics for ""promoting the official Communist Party line."" (This was a tic of Skousen's; he later
defended the Mormon policy of denying the priesthood to blacks with a pamphlet called ""The Communist Attack on the
Mormons."")
All along, Skousen's evolving thoughts ran in tandem with Welch's. In ""The Naked Communist,"" a lengthy primer
published in 1958, he enlivened a survey of the worldwide leftist threat with outlandish claims, writing that F.D.R.'s adviser
Harry Hopkins had treasonously delivered to the Soviets a large supply of uranium, and that the Russians built the first
Sputnik with plans stolen from the United States. A year before Richard Condon's novel ""The Manchurian Candidate""
appeared, Skousen announced that the Communists were creating ""a regimented breed of Pavlovian men whose minds
could be triggered into immediate action by signals from their masters."" A later book, ""The Naked Capitalist,"" decried the
Ivy League Establishment, who, through the Federal Reserve, the Council on Foreign Relations, and the Rockefeller
Foundation, formed ""the world's secret power structure."" The conspiracy had begun, Skousen wrote, when reformers like
the wealthy banker Edward M. (Colonel) House, a close adviser to President Woodrow Wilson, helped put into place the
Federal Reserve and the graduated income tax.
In 1971, Skousen organized another group, the Freemen Institute, which he later renamed the National Center for
Constitutional Studies. According to an article published in the Review of Religious Research, the center's targets
included ""the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Federal
Communication Commission's fairness doctrine in editorial broadcasting, the federal government's change of the gold
standard in currency, all subsidies to farmers, all federal aid to education, all federal social welfare, foreign aid, social
security, elimination of public school prayer and Bible reading, and (that familiar right-wing nemesis) the United Nations.""
Skousen's pronouncements made him a pariah among most conservative activists, including some on the right-wing
fringe. In 1962, the ultraconservative American Security Council threw him out, because members felt that he had ""gone
off the deep end."" In 1971, a review in the Mormon journal Dialogue accused Skousen of ""inventing fantastic ideas and
making inferences that go far beyond the bounds of honest commentary,"" and advancing doctrines that came ""perilously
close"" to Nazism. And in 1979, after Skousen called President.Jimmy Carter a puppet of the Council on Foreign Relations
and the Rockefeller family, the president of the Mormon church issued a national order banning announcements about his
organizations.
Skousen was undeterred. In 1981, he produced ""The 5,000 Year Leap,"" a treatise that assembles selective quotations
and groundless assertions to claim that the U.S. Constitution is rooted not in the Enlightenment but in the Bible, and that
the framers believed in minimal central government. Either proposition would have astounded James Madison, often
described as the guiding spirit behind the Constitution, who rejected state-established religions and, like Alexander
Hamilton, proposed a central government so strong that it could veto state laws. ""The 5,000 Year Leap"" is not a fervid
book. Instead, it is calmly, ingratiatingly misleading. Skousen quotes various eighteenth-century patriots on the evils of
what Samuel Adams, in 1768, called ""the Utopian schemes of leveling,"" which Skousen equates with redistribution of
wealth. But he does not mention the Founders' endorsement of taxing the rich to support the general welfare. Thomas
Jefferson, for example, wrote approvingly in 1811 of having federal taxes (then limited to tariffs) fall solely on the wealthy,
which meant that ""the farmer will see his government supported, his children educated, and the face of his country made
a paradise by the contributions of the rich alone, without his being called on to spend a cent from his earnings.""
Skousen also challenges the separation of church and state, asserting that ""the Founders were not indulging in any idle
gesture when they adopted the motto 'In God We Trust.' ""In reality, the motto that came out of the Constitutional
Convention was ""E Pluribus Unum"": out of many, one. ""In God We Trust"" came much later; its use on coins was first
permitted in 1864, and only in 1955, at the height of the Cold War, did Congress mandate that it appear on all currency.
The following year, President Eisenhower—who Welch charged was a Communist agent—approved ""In God We Trust"" as
the national motto.
In 1982, Skousen published a follow-up work, an ancestor-worshipping history text titled The Making of America,"" and
prepared a study guide for nationwide seminars based on its contents. As Alexander Zaitchik reports in his informative
study of Beck, ""Common Nonsense,"" the new book became an object of controversy in 1987, after the California
Bicentennial Commission sold it as part of a fund-raising drive. Among its offenses was an account of slavery drawn from
long-disgraced work by the historian Fred A. Shannon, which characterized slave children as ""pickaninnies"" and
suggested that the worst victims of slavery were the slaveholders themselves. The constitutional scholar Jack Rakove, of
Stanford, inspected Skousen's book and seminars and pronounced them ""a joke that no self-respecting scholar would
think is worth a warm pitcher of spit.""
By the time Skousen died, in 2006, he was little remembered outside the ranks of the furthest-right Mormons. Then, in
2009, Glenn Beck began touting his work: ""The Naked Communist,"" ""The Naked Capitalist,"" and, especially, ""The 5,000
Year Leap,"" which he called ""essential to understanding why our Founders built this Republic the way they did."" After
Beck put the book in the first spot on his required-reading list—and wrote an enthusiastic new introduction for its reissue—
it shot to the top of the Amazon best-seller list. In the first half of 2009, it sold more than two hundred and fifty thousand
copies. Local branches of the Tea Party Patriots, the United American Tea Party, and other groups across the country
have since organized study groups around it. ""It is time we learn and follow the FREEDOM principles of our Founding
Fathers,"" a United American Tea Party video declares, referring to the principles expounded by Skousen's book. If Beck is
the movement's teacher, ""The 5,000 Year Leap"" has become its primer, with ""The Making of America"" as a kind of 102-
level text.
The popularity of Beck's broadcasts, which now reach two million viewers each day, has brought neo-Birchite ideas to an
audience beyond any that Welch or Skousen might have dreamed of. Several times a week, Beck informs his audience
that socialists (whom he also sometimes calls Fascists or Communists) led by Obama have seized power, and that
patriotic Americans must take their country back. His TV show for some time featured ""Comrade Updates,"" in which Beck
described perfidy while the Soviet anthem played in the background. He attacks all the familiar bogeymen: the Federal
Reserve System (which he asserts is a private conglomerate, unaccountable to the public); the Council on Foreign
Relations (born of a ""progressive idea"" to manipulate the media in order to ""let the masses know what should be done"");
and a historical procession of evildoers, including Skousen's old target Colonel House and Welch's old target Woodrow
Wilson. His sources on these matters, quite apart from Skousen's books, can be unreliable. On September 22nd, amid a
diatribe about House, Beck cited a passage from ""Secrets of the Federal Reserve,"" by Eustace Mullins. The book,
commissioned in 1948 by Ezra Pound, is a startlingly anti-Semitic fantasy of how a Jewish-led conspiracy of all-powerful
bankers established the Federal Reserve in service of their plot to dominate the world.
Part of Beck's allure is the promise that he will reveal secret information. In one segment last year, he produced a drawing
of fasces—which he described, anachronistically, as ""the Roman symbol of Fascism""—and then a picture of an old
Mercury dime, with fasces on the reverse side. ""Who brought this dime in? It happened in 1916—Woodrow Wilson was
the President,"" he said. ""We've been on the road to Fascism for a while."" Benito Mussolini, of course, didn't adopt the
ancient symbol of authority as the Fascist emblem until the nineteen-twenties; the designer of the coin, the sculptor
Adolph A. Weinman, intended it to signify the nation's military preparedness, and paired it with an olive branch to illustrate
the desire for peace.
Beck's readings of Progressive-era politics are nearly as bizarre. Whatever can be said about Theodore Roosevelt, he
was not a crypto-radical. It was Roosevelt who coined the term ""lunatic fringe"" to describe the extreme leftists of his day,
and his concept of New Nationalism—in which an activist government built a vibrant capitalism, partly by regulating big
business—looked back to Alexander Hamilton, not Karl Marx. Nor was Wilson a Bolshevik; in fact, in 1917 he sent
American troops to Russia to support the anti-Bolshevik White Army. At home, his reforms sought to break up monopolies
in order to restore competition among small companies. ""If America is not to have free enterprise,"" Wilson declared, ""then
she can have no freedom of any sort whatever.""
In 2007, Beck, then the host of ""Glenn Beck,"" on CNN's Headline News, brought to his show a John Birch Society
spokesman named Sam Antonio, who warned of a government plot to abolish U.S. borders with Mexico and Canada,
""and eventually all throughout the Americas."" Beck told Antonio, ""When I was growing up, the John Birch Society—I
thought they were a bunch of nuts."" But now, he said, ""you guys are starting to make more and more sense to me."" His
guest beamed. ""Yes, we at the John Birch Society are not nuts,"" Antonio said. ""We are just exposing the truth that's been
out there for many, many years."" Since then, the Birch Society's Web site has run clips from Beck's Fox broadcasts,
proudly pointing out similarities with their own ideas. Last June, an essay on the site described a presentation by Beck on
Communism in America as ""the ultimate in complete agreement between the Beck and JBS presentations of American
history.""
Beck has also praised Ezra Taft Benson, one of Skousen's close associates. Benson, the Secretary of Agriculture under
President Eisenhower and the thirteenth president of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, gained notoriety for
a speech in 1966 in which he denounced Democratic officeholders and intellectuals (including the historian Arthur M.
Schlesinger, Jr.) as socialists and Communist sympathizers, warned that ""the Constitution will be endangered and hang,
as it were, by a single thread,"" and praised the John Birch Society as ""the most effective non-church organization in our
fight against creeping socialism and Godless Communism."" Last June, Beck aired a clip from another Benson speech,
intoning, ""Ezra Taft Benson warned about what was coming."" The Birch Society's Web site subsequently praised Beck for
""getting progressively (sorry for the bad word choice) closer to presenting American history in the way that The John Birch
Society has been doing it for over 50 years.""
Beck is no more the sole representative of today's multifaceted Tea Party than Welch or Skousen was of the nineteen-
sixties far right; he recently told the Times, a bit disingenuously, that he was ""not involved with the Tea Party."" Why, then,
have the politics of Skousen, Benson, and the John Birch Society had such a resurgence among conservative
Republicans—not just through Beck but through Tea Party heroes like the Nevada Republican Senate candidate Sharron
Angle? (Last month, Angle gave a warm address to a ""freedom conference"" in Salt Lake City, co-sponsored by the John
Birch Society and Skousen's old group, the National Center for Constitutional Studies, praising her audience as
""mainstream America"" and patriots who had ""heard the call."") The columnist Frank Rich, among others, has suggested
that the election of a black President sowed ""fears of disenfranchisement among a dwindling and threatened minority in
the country."" There are signs that this is so: Republicans' singling out of Thurgood Marshall as an ""activist Justice"" during
Elena Kagan's Supreme Court confirmation hearings, the warnings on Fox News about the terrible dangers posed by the
minuscule New Black Panther Party. But ""socialist"" is not a racial slur. Jim Crow was not built out of fears of the Federal
Reserve and the I.R.S. The Tea Party's fulminations against cap-and-trade, federal-government bailouts, and big
government generally play on very old themes that have nothing to do with the color of President Obama's skin.
The current right-wing resurgence has more to do with the inner dynamics of American conservatism in the past half
century. In the nineteen-fifties and nineteen-sixties, the far right was condemned by liberals, as might be expected; in
November, 1961, President Kennedy devoted part of a speech in Los Angeles to denouncing those ""discordant voices of
extremism"" that ""equate the Democratic Party with the welfare state, the welfare state with socialism, and socialism with
Communism."" But the Bircher right also provoked deep anxiety among conservatives, who feared being perceived as
paranoids and conspiracy-mongers.
The leading intellectual spokesman and organizer of the anti-Bircher conservatives was William F. Buckley, Jr., the editor
of National Review. Buckley was by no means moderate in his conservatism. He was a lifelong defender of Joseph
McCarthy and a foe of New Deal liberalism. But he drew the line at claiming that the course of American government was
set by a socialist conspiracy, and he feared that the ravings of the extreme right would cost more balanced, practical
conservatives their chance at national power. ""By 1961,"" his biographer John B. Judis writes, ""Buckley was beginning to
worry that with the John Birch Society growing so rapidly, the right-wing upsurge in the country would take an ugly, even
Fascist turn rather than leading toward the kind of conservatism National Review had promoted."" In the next two decades,
with Buckley's support and counsel, Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan completed a conservative revolution that
succeeded by keeping extremist elements far from the centers of power.
As confidant and adviser to leading conservative politicians, Buckley had far more political influence than might be
expected from the editor of a weekly journal. Yet in the early nineteen-sixties he found fighting the Birchers and their
fellow-travellers extremely difficult. Even though some of Buckley's colleagues at National Review thought that the Birch
Society went too far, they would not attack the society publicly, for fear of alienating both the Birchers and the
conservatives who sympathized with their views. When Buckley wrote an editorial in 1962 that accused Welch of
""distorting reality"" and failing to make ""the crucial moral and political distinction"" between Communists and liberals, the
magazine immediately lost subscriptions and financial support.
By 1960, Senator Barry Goldwater, of Arizona, was emerging as the great political hope of conservative Republicans, and
he consulted closely with Buckley. At a meeting at the Breakers hotel, in Palm Beach, in January, 1962, Buckley urged
Goldwater to repudiate the Birch Society. Goldwater demurred; though he conceded that some embarrassing ""kooks""
lurked among the Birchers, he insisted to Buckley that there were also some ""nice guys,"" and that it would be injudicious
to attack the group in public. The Birchers' support helped gain Goldwater the Republican Presidential nomination in
1964, and he winked at them in his acceptance speech with his famous line: ""Extremism in the defense of liberty is no
vice. . . . Moderation in the pursuit of justice is no virtue.""
In the general election, though, Goldwater suffered a crushing loss to Lyndon Johnson, partly because Democrats
succeeded in making him look like a captive of the loony right. (To the Goldwater slogan ""In Your Heart, You Know He's
Right,"" the Democrats shot back, ""In Your Guts, You Know He's Nuts."") Buckley's fears had been confirmed. But he was
undeterred in his efforts to build a respectable and viable conservative movement. In 1967, he favored Richard Nixon
among a field of Republican aspirants. He liked Ronald Reagan's politics, but considered Reagan, who had only recently
been elected the governor of California, too new to national politics. George Romney, the governor of Michigan, a wishy-
washy moderate, was obviously unsuitable, to say nothing of the Republican archliberal Nelson Rockefeller, of New York.
Nixon was a hard-nosed Republican with strong conservative views, especially on Communism and the Cold War; he had
established himself as a Communist-hunter in the nineteen-forties by pressing the charge that Alger Hiss, a former official
at the State Department, had spied for the Soviets. And, promisingly, Nixon was the front-runner. ""It seems to me that we
ought to have a real chance of winning this year,"" Buckley wrote to Goldwater around the time of the Republican National
Convention. He served the campaign as an adviser, and by aiding his friend Frank Shakespeare, who had taken charge
of Nixon's media operations.
But Buckley's candidate had a reputation for shiftiness that made him unpopular across the political spectrum. Some of
the editors of National Review, recalling that Nixon had cut a deal with Rockefeller in order to secure the G.O.P.
nomination in 1960, didn't sufficiently trust him. And the Birch Society had nothing but contempt for the figure whom
Welch had called one of ""the slipperiest politicians that ever showed up on the American scene."" As President, in 1969,
Nixon began to open diplomatic relations with Communist China, and the right wing placed him on its list of perfidious
appeasers. When he visited Beijing in 1972, even Buckley was deeply offended. But when the general election took place
later that year, with the antiwar Democratic candidate, George McGovern, voicing the country's anxieties over Vietnam,
Buckley and the mainstream of what he called ""responsible conservatism"" returned to Nixon. The purist conservatives
were left to back the third-party candidacy of John Schmitz, a Republican congressman and a member of the John Birch
Society.
Nixon won in a landslide, and the next year he appointed Buckley the American delegate to the United Nations. The
conservative pragmatists had found the way to real power. And, despite the embarrassment of Watergate, in Nixon's
second term, their strategy proved effective over time. Nixon's campaign against McGovern sharpened the Democrats'
internal divisions over civil rights and Vietnam, and, Buckley wrote, revealed that the Democrats had ""an indifference
toward national independence and a hostility toward national freedom."" Meanwhile, the Buckley mainstream, having read
the Birchers out of the conservative movement, established itself as a permanent and growing force in the Republican
Party and in national politics.
In 1976, Buckley and National Review supported Ronald Reagan's primary challenge to Nixon's successor, Gerald Ford.
After two terms as governor, Reagan had matured into what Buckley considered a nearly ideal conservative politician: a
shrewd leader as well as a man of principle. Reagan nearly succeeded in wresting the nomination from Ford,
demonstrating how formidable a national figure he had become. The Bircher right had flourished in his political bastion of
Orange County, and Reagan was adept at winning extremists' allegiance while he pursued realistic strategies. His
pragmatic side showed immediately after he finally secured the Republican nomination in 1980, when he chose the
relatively moderate George H. W. Bush, his bitter foe during the primaries, as his running mate. Though the decision
dismayed right-wing ideologues, it had two practical benefits: it instantly healed the divisions between Republican
moderates and conservatives, and it helped dampen charges from the Democrats that Reagan was a reckless right-
winger. Nobody was more pleased by Bush's selection than his fellow Skull and Bones man William F. Buckley, who
understood the political logic as clearly as Reagan had.
As President, Reagan flattered the extremists—he even delivered some admiring words about Skousen's Freemen
Institute—but he saved his political capital for his real goals: undoing the fiscal underpinnings of New Deal-style
government, and redirecting U.S. foreign policy by battling the Soviet Union and its proxies around the world. He
appointed moderates to positions of importance, as when he made James Baker III, Bush's close associate, his first chief
of staff, rather than the far more ideological Edwin Meese III, his former chief of staff from California. (As a top policy
adviser, Meese helped Reagan stack the federal bench with conservatives, but he was otherwise eclipsed by Baker and
Baker's deputy, the pragmatic Reaganite Michael Deaver, and his crusade, as Attorney General, to roll back civil-rights
legislation largely failed.) When zealots in the Administration were exposed, as in the Iran-Contra scandal, Reagan
skillfully evaded responsibility and replaced them with more centrist Republicans. And, when he recognized in Mikhail
Gorbachev a Soviet leader with whom he could undertake genuine efforts to reduce the nuclear threat, Reagan pushed
forward, ignoring the complaints that he had become, in the hard-liner Howard Phillips's phrase, ""a useful idiot for Soviet
propaganda.""
Whatever misgivings may have arisen about him on the right, Reagan achieved a dramatic conservative overhaul of the
federal tax code, a profound reconfiguring of the judiciary, and a near-victory for the West in the Cold War. From the
standpoint of the mainstream right, the only problem with his legacy was that no other Republican could come close to
matching his public appeal and political savvy. For the party of Reagan, his departure was the beginning of a long decline,
and it is the absence of a similarly totemic figure, during the past twenty years, that has allowed the current resurgence of
extremism. George H. W. Bush repelled right-wingers with his moderate tendencies—not least when, in the face of fiscal
calamity, he broke his campaign pledge not to raise taxes. Bill Clinton inspired them to an almost ecstatic series of
attacks, and though there remained enough of an older conservative establishment, personified by Senator Bob Dole, to
check some of the wildest charges, the new Republican House majority after 1994, pushed by such ideologues as Tom
DeLay and Dick Armey, had little interest in maintaining the center. They harassed Clinton, forcing an impeachment even
though polls showed that more than sixty per cent of the American people disapproved. George W. Bush seemed at first
to have a bit of Reagan's conservative charisma, but the right wing turned against him for failing to win the war in Iraq, for
his moderate position on immigration, and for spending hundreds of millions of federal dollars to combat the financial
collapse in 2008. When William F. Buckley died, during the 2008 primary season, it seemed to symbolize the end of a
conservative era. David Klinghoffer, a former literary editor at National Review, lamented that ""urbane visionaries and
builders of institutions"" such as Buckley have been replaced by media figures ""who make their money by stirring fears and
resentments."" Conservatism, Klinghoffer added, ""has undergone a shift toward demagoguery and hucksterism,"" and is
now ruled by those he called ""the crazy-cons.""
Some Republicans have tried to extend the Buckley tradition, but to little effect. The commentator David Frum, a former
speechwriter for George W. Bush, lost his job at the American Enterprise Institute after he complained about the
Republicans' obstruction of health-care reform and called the right-wing surge a threat to conservatism. In June, the
congressman Bob Inglis, of South Carolina, a tough conservative who nonetheless backed Bush's financial bailout, lost a
vicious primary fight with a right-wing insurgent named Trey Gowdy. To his amazement, Inglis was confronted on the
campaign trail by voters who were convinced that numbers on their Social Security cards indicated that a secret bank had
bought them at birth. ""And then, of course,"" he recalls, ""it turned into something about the Federal Reserve and the
Bilderbergers and all that stuff."" Not even Karl Rove can afford open dissent with the Tea Partiers. Appearing on Fox
News the night of the recent primaries, he described the Tea Party-backed Senate candidate in Delaware, Christine
O'Donnell, as probably unelectable and said that some of her statements were ""nutty."" Instantly, criticism came from
Sarah Palin, Rush Limbaugh, and other right-wing Republicans. Within days, he was back on Fox, proclaiming himself ""a
huge Tea Party fan,"" endorsing O'Donnell, and affirming that the National Republican Senatorial Committee would give
her its full backing.
So far, Rove, an unlikely dissident, is the only prominent Republican leader to so much as gesture at stepping forward, as
Buckley and his allies did. Even strong conservatives like Inglis have been pushed aside, as have such former G.O.P.
stalwarts as Charlie Crist, in Florida, and Mike Castle, in Delaware, both beaten in the primaries by Tea Party candidates;
Grist is now running a long-shot campaign as an Independent. Desperate for gains in the midterm elections, the
Republicans are neglecting the struggle it took to make politics safe for Reagan.
Fifty years ago, President Kennedy deplored the far right's ""counsels of fear and suspicion."" Today, Obama's White
House is still struggling to make sense of its enemies. In the absence of forthright leadership, on both the right and the
left, the job of standing up to extremists appears to have been left to the electorate. Candidates like O'Donnell may prove
too eccentric to prevail, or voters may simply become disillusioned by politicians who campaign on their hatred of
government. After the election, mainstream conservatives may well engage in what Richard Viguerie has forecast as ""a
massive, almost historic battle for the heart and soul of the Republican Party."" (Already, Rove and some leading Bush
political operatives, including the former Republican National Committee chairman Ed Gillespie, have been quietly
supplanting the battered G.O.P. establishment in the effort to raise funds for this year's candidates.) But, according to a
recent poll, more than seventy per cent of Republicans support the Tea Party, and it seems almost certain that a
Republican Party that has unstintingly appeased the far right will enjoy a strong and perhaps smashing victory in the
coming midterm elections.
In 1906, early in the Progressive era, the humorist Finley Peter Dunne's fictional barroom sage, Mr. Dooley, put the social
and political tumult of the day into perspective. ""Th' noise ye hear is not th' first gun iv a revolution,"" Dooley remarked. ""It's
on'y th' people iv th' United States batin' a carpet."" A century from now, or even a year from now, Americans may say the
same about the Tea Party. For the moment, though, it appears that the extreme right wing is on the verge of securing a
degree of power over Congress and the Republican Party that is unprecedented in modern American history. For
defenders of national cohesion and tempered adversity in our politics, it is an alarming state of affairs. •

The Tea Party's Cold War roots.
by Sean Wilentz October 18, 2010
ann Beck's view of American history stems from the paranoid politics of the fifties.
A few months ago, the cable-television and radio host Glenn Beck began his Fox News show with one of his favorite
props: a pipe clenched between his teeth. ""I've got my pipe,"" he told his audience, his speech slightly muddled by the
stem, ""because we're going to speak about schoolish kind of things."" The theme of the day was ""Restoring History,"" and
Beck, looking professorial in a neat dark blazer and a pink button-down shirt, began the lesson by peering at a stack of
history textbooks and pronouncing them full of falsehoods, produced by ""malicious progressive intent."" Progressives, he
explained—liberals, socialists, Communists, the entire spectrum of the left—""knew they had to separate us from our
history to be able to separate us from our Constitution and God."" For the next hour, Beck earnestly explained some of the
history that ""is being stolen from us"": the depression of 1920, for example, or how conservative economics saved the
nation from the ""near-depression"" of 1946—crises that progressives don't want you to know about. ""You've been taught
one lie, I think, your whole life,"" he said.
For the fractious Tea Party movement, Beck—a former drive-time radio jockey, a recovering alcoholic, and a Mormon
convert—has emerged as both a unifying figure and an intellectual guide. One opinion poll, released in July by
Democracy Corps, showed that he is ""the most highly regarded individual among Tea Party supporters,"" seen not merely
as an entertainer, like Rush Limbaugh, but as an ""educator."" And in the past few months Beck has established his own
institute of learning: the online, for-profit Beck University. Enrollees can take courses like Faith 102, which contends with
""revisionists and secular progressives"" about the separation of church and state; Hope 102, an attack on the activist
federal government; and the combined Charity 101/102/103, a highly restrictive interpretation of rights, federalism, and the
division of powers.
During the ""Restoring History"" episode, Beck twice encouraged viewers to join his Web seminars, where they can hear
""lessons from the best and brightest historians and scholars that we could find."" The B.U. faculty consists of three
members, including one bona-fide academic, James R. Stoner, Jr., the chair of the political-science department at
Louisiana State University; the other two are the head of a management consulting firm and the founder of WallBuilders,
which the Web site calls ""a national pro-family organization."" Beck himself often acts as a professor, a slightly jocular one,
on his Fox News program. Surrounded by charts and figures, he offers explanations of current politics and history lessons
about the country's long march to Obama-era totalitarianism. The decline, he says, began with the Progressive era of the
early twentieth century, in particular with the Presidency of Woodrow Wilson, when both the Federal Reserve System and
the graduated federal income tax came into existence. ""Wilson,"" Beck told his radio audience in August, ""just despised
what America was.""

Beck's claims have found an audience among Tea Party spokesmen and sympathizers. At the movement's Freedom
Summit in Washington last September, one activist told a reporter, ""The election between Teddy Roosevelt and Woodrow
Wilson in 1912 was when it started going downhill."" And in April an angry member of the Tea Party Patriots group from
Cape Fear, North Carolina, claimed on the group's Web site that ""the very things you see happening in this country today
started with the Wilson Administration.""
At a Tax Day rally this past spring, the veteran conservative organizer Richard Viguerie described the Tea Party as ""an
unfettered new force of the middle class."" And, indeed, calling Obama a socialist in the tradition of Woodrow Wilson is
audacious enough to seem like the marker of a new movement—or, at least, a new twist in the nation's long history of
conspiracy-mongering. In fact, it marks a revival of ideas that circulated on the extremist right half a century ago,
especially in the John Birch Society and among its admirers.
Beck's version of American history relies on lessons from his own acknowledged inspiration, the late right-wing writer W.
Cleon Skousen, and also restates charges made by the Birch Society's founder, Robert Welch. The political universe is,
of course, very different today from what it was during the Cold War. Yet the Birchers' politics and their view of American
history—which focussed more on totalitarian threats at home than on those posed by the Soviet Union and Communist
China—has proved remarkably persistent. The pressing historical question is how extremist ideas held at bay for decades
inside the Republican Party have exploded anew—and why, this time, Party leaders have done virtually nothing to
challenge those ideas, and a great deal to abet them.
The early nineteen-sixties were a turbulent time in American politics, for the right wing in particular. In the South, racist
violence against civil-rights workers was constant, deepening sectional splits in the Democratic Party that would in time
deliver the once solidly Democratic South to the Republicans. Southern elected officials, in support of what they called
""massive resistance"" to civil-rights laws and judicial rulings, resurrected the ideas of nullification and interposition, which
claimed that individual states could void federal laws within their own borders. Others focussed on what they considered a
fearsome Communist menace inside the United States. General Edwin A. Walker caused an enormous stir when he
resigned from the Army in 1961, after President John F. Kennedy's Pentagon reprimanded him for spreading right-wing
propaganda among his troops and accusing prominent American officials of Communist sympathies. Senator Strom
Thurmond, the Dixiecrat from South Carolina, spoke for many on the far right when he declared that various modestly
liberal domestic programs ""fall clearly within the category of socialism.""
The John Birch Society was one of the decade's most controversial right-wing organizations. Founded in 1958 by Robert
Welch, a candy manufacturer from Massachusetts, the society took its name from a Baptist missionary and military-
intelligence officer killed by Communist Chinese forces in 1945, whom Welch called the first American casualty of the
Cold War. The group was founded at a propitious time. After Senator Joseph McCarthy's fall, in 1954, many of McCarthy's
followers felt bereft of a voice, and Welch seemed to speak for them; by the mid-sixties, his society's membership was
estimated to be as high as a hundred thousand. Welch, exploiting fears of what McCarthy had called an ""immense""
domestic conspiracy, declared that the federal government had already fallen into the Communists' clutches. In a tract
titled ""The Politician,"" he attacked President Dwight D. Eisenhower as ""a dedicated, conscious agent of the Communist
conspiracy"" who had been serving the plot ""all of his adult life."" Late in 1961, after the disastrous Bay of Pigs invasion, he
accused the Kennedy Administration of ""helping the Communists everywhere in the world while pretending to do the
opposite.""
Wherever he looked, Welch saw Communist forces manipulating American economic and foreign policy on behalf of
totalitarianism. But within the United States, he believed, the subversion had actually begun years before the Bolshevik
Revolution. Conflating modern liberalism and totalitarianism, Welch described government as ""always and inevitably an
enemy of individual freedom."" Consequently, he charged, the Progressive era, which expanded the federal government's
role in curbing social and economic ills, was a dire period in our history, and Woodrow Wilson ""more than any other one
man started this nation on its present road to totalitarianism.""
In the nineteen-sixties, Welch became convinced that even the Communist movement was but ""a tool of the total
conspiracy."" This master conspiracy, he said, had forerunners in ancient Sparta, and sprang fully to life in the eighteenth
century, in the ""uniformly Satanic creed and program"" of the Bavarian Illuminati. Run by those he called ""the Insiders,"" the
conspiracy resided chiefly in international families of financiers, such as the Rothschilds and the Rockefellers, government
agencies like the Federal Reserve System and the Internal Revenue Service, and nongovernmental organizations like the
Bilderberg Group, the Council on Foreign Relations, and the Trilateral Commission. Since the early twentieth century, they
had done a good deal of their evil work under the guise of humanitarian uplift. ""One broad avenue down which these
conspiratorial forces advance was known as progressive legislation,"" Welch declared in 1966. ""The very same collectivist
theories and demagogic pretenses which had destroyed earlier civilizations were now paraded forth in the disguise of new
and modern concepts.""
In the worst case, Welch believed, military action might be necessary to dislodge the totalitarians. But for the moment a
nonviolent political revolution would suffice. Accordingly, he designed the Birch Society roughly, if not explicitly, on the
Marxist-Leninist model of a vanguard revolutionary party: a series of small cells that would work in secret to agitate the
populace and elect right-thinking candidates to office. ""It isn't numbers we have to worry about,"" Welch wrote, ""but the
courage on the part of our followers to stick their necks out and play rough—the same as the Communists do.""
The ""Founder"" himself would dictate the society's policies, advised by a council of about two dozen businessmen and
professionals, and the local cells would be overseen by unyielding commanders. ""It is the leadership that is most
demanding, most exacting of its followers,"" Welch observed, ""that achieves really dedicated support."" Welch's group

became synonymous with right-wing extremism, earning satirical blasts from critics ranging from the cartoonist Walt Kelly
to the musicians Bob Dylan and Dizzy Gillespie. The trumpeter, whose actual name was John Birks Gillespie, made a
humorous run for the Presidency in 1964, organizing John Birks Societies in twenty-five states.
Still, the most outlandish of the era's right-wing anti-Communists was not Welch but Willard Cleon Skousen. A
transplanted Canadian who served as a Mormon missionary in his teens, Skousen was considered so radical in the early
nineteen-sixties that even J. Edgar Hoover's F.B.I. watched him closely; one 1962 memo in his extensive F.B.I. file noted
that ""during the past year or so, Skousen has affiliated himself with the extreme right-wing 'professional communists' who
are promoting their own anticommunism for obvious financial purposes."" Skousen was himself employed by the F.B.I.,
from 1935 until 1951, much of that time as a special agent working chiefly in administration. These desk jobs, he claimed
implausibly, gave him access to confidential domestic intelligence about Communism. Skousen also maintained that he
had served as Hoover's administrative assistant; Hoover informed inquirers that there was no such position.
Skousen taught for years in the speech and religion departments at Brigham Young University, interrupted by a stint, from
1956 to 1960, as the police chief of Salt Lake City. His time in office was contentious, and after he raided a friendly card
game attended by the city's right-wing mayor, J. Bracken Lee, he was promptly fired. Lee called Skousen ""a master of half
truths"" and said that he ran the police department ""like a Gestapo""; Skousen's supporters placed burning crosses on the
Mayor's lawn.
After losing his police job, Skousen founded a group called the All-American Society, which Time described in 1961 as an
exemplar of the far-right ""ultras."" Although he did not join the Birch Society, Skousen worked with its American Opinion
Speakers' Bureau, and, in 1963, wrote a rousing tract titled ""The Communist Attack on the John Birch Society,"" which
condemned the society's critics for ""promoting the official Communist Party line."" (This was a tic of Skousen's; he later
defended the Mormon policy of denying the priesthood to blacks with a pamphlet called ""The Communist Attack on the
Mormons."")
All along, Skousen's evolving thoughts ran in tandem with Welch's. In ""The Naked Communist,"" a lengthy primer
published in 1958, he enlivened a survey of the worldwide leftist threat with outlandish claims, writing that F.D.R.'s adviser
Harry Hopkins had treasonously delivered to the Soviets a large supply of uranium, and that the Russians built the first
Sputnik with plans stolen from the United States. A year before Richard Condon's novel ""The Manchurian Candidate""
appeared, Skousen announced that the Communists were creating ""a regimented breed of Pavlovian men whose minds
could be triggered into immediate action by signals from their masters."" A later book, ""The Naked Capitalist,"" decried the
Ivy League Establishment, who, through the Federal Reserve, the Council on Foreign Relations, and the Rockefeller
Foundation, formed ""the world's secret power structure."" The conspiracy had begun, Skousen wrote, when reformers like
the wealthy banker Edward M. (Colonel) House, a close adviser to President Woodrow Wilson, helped put into place the
Federal Reserve and the graduated income tax.
In 1971, Skousen organized another group, the Freemen Institute, which he later renamed the National Center for
Constitutional Studies. According to an article published in the Review of Religious Research, the center's targets
included ""the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Federal
Communication Commission's fairness doctrine in editorial broadcasting, the federal government's change of the gold
standard in currency, all subsidies to farmers, all federal aid to education, all federal social welfare, foreign aid, social
security, elimination of public school prayer and Bible reading, and (that familiar right-wing nemesis) the United Nations.""
Skousen's pronouncements made him a pariah among most conservative activists, including some on the right-wing
fringe. In 1962, the ultraconservative American Security Council threw him out, because members felt that he had ""gone
off the deep end."" In 1971, a review in the Mormon journal Dialogue accused Skousen of ""inventing fantastic ideas and
making inferences that go far beyond the bounds of honest commentary,"" and advancing doctrines that came ""perilously
close"" to Nazism. And in 1979, after Skousen called President.Jimmy Carter a puppet of the Council on Foreign Relations
and the Rockefeller family, the president of the Mormon church issued a national order banning announcements about his
organizations.
Skousen was undeterred. In 1981, he produced ""The 5,000 Year Leap,"" a treatise that assembles selective quotations
and groundless assertions to claim that the U.S. Constitution is rooted not in the Enlightenment but in the Bible, and that
the framers believed in minimal central government. Either proposition would have astounded James Madison, often
described as the guiding spirit behind the Constitution, who rejected state-established religions and, like Alexander
Hamilton, proposed a central government so strong that it could veto state laws. ""The 5,000 Year Leap"" is not a fervid
book. Instead, it is calmly, ingratiatingly misleading. Skousen quotes various eighteenth-century patriots on the evils of
what Samuel Adams, in 1768, called ""the Utopian schemes of leveling,"" which Skousen equates with redistribution of
wealth. But he does not mention the Founders' endorsement of taxing the rich to support the general welfare. Thomas
Jefferson, for example, wrote approvingly in 1811 of having federal taxes (then limited to tariffs) fall solely on the wealthy,
which meant that ""the farmer will see his government supported, his children educated, and the face of his country made
a paradise by the contributions of the rich alone, without his being called on to spend a cent from his earnings.""
Skousen also challenges the separation of church and state, asserting that ""the Founders were not indulging in any idle
gesture when they adopted the motto 'In God We Trust.' ""In reality, the motto that came out of the Constitutional
Convention was ""E Pluribus Unum"": out of many, one. ""In God We Trust"" came much later; its use on coins was first
permitted in 1864, and only in 1955, at the height of the Cold War, did Congress mandate that it appear on all currency.
The following year, President Eisenhower—who Welch charged was a Communist agent—approved ""In God We Trust"" as
the national motto.

In 1982, Skousen published a follow-up work, an ancestor-worshipping history text titled The Making of America,"" and
prepared a study guide for nationwide seminars based on its contents. As Alexander Zaitchik reports in his informative
study of Beck, ""Common Nonsense,"" the new book became an object of controversy in 1987, after the California
Bicentennial Commission sold it as part of a fund-raising drive. Among its offenses was an account of slavery drawn from
long-disgraced work by the historian Fred A. Shannon, which characterized slave children as ""pickaninnies"" and
suggested that the worst victims of slavery were the slaveholders themselves. The constitutional scholar Jack Rakove, of
Stanford, inspected Skousen's book and seminars and pronounced them ""a joke that no self-respecting scholar would
think is worth a warm pitcher of spit.""
By the time Skousen died, in 2006, he was little remembered outside the ranks of the furthest-right Mormons. Then, in
2009, Glenn Beck began touting his work: ""The Naked Communist,"" ""The Naked Capitalist,"" and, especially, ""The 5,000
Year Leap,"" which he called ""essential to understanding why our Founders built this Republic the way they did."" After
Beck put the book in the first spot on his required-reading list—and wrote an enthusiastic new introduction for its reissue—
it shot to the top of the Amazon best-seller list. In the first half of 2009, it sold more than two hundred and fifty thousand
copies. Local branches of the Tea Party Patriots, the United American Tea Party, and other groups across the country
have since organized study groups around it. ""It is time we learn and follow the FREEDOM principles of our Founding
Fathers,"" a United American Tea Party video declares, referring to the principles expounded by Skousen's book. If Beck is
the movement's teacher, ""The 5,000 Year Leap"" has become its primer, with ""The Making of America"" as a kind of 102-
level text.
The popularity of Beck's broadcasts, which now reach two million viewers each day, has brought neo-Birchite ideas to an
audience beyond any that Welch or Skousen might have dreamed of. Several times a week, Beck informs his audience
that socialists (whom he also sometimes calls Fascists or Communists) led by Obama have seized power, and that
patriotic Americans must take their country back. His TV show for some time featured ""Comrade Updates,"" in which Beck
described perfidy while the Soviet anthem played in the background. He attacks all the familiar bogeymen: the Federal
Reserve System (which he asserts is a private conglomerate, unaccountable to the public); the Council on Foreign
Relations (born of a ""progressive idea"" to manipulate the media in order to ""let the masses know what should be done"");
and a historical procession of evildoers, including Skousen's old target Colonel House and Welch's old target Woodrow
Wilson. His sources on these matters, quite apart from Skousen's books, can be unreliable. On September 22nd, amid a
diatribe about House, Beck cited a passage from ""Secrets of the Federal Reserve,"" by Eustace Mullins. The book,
commissioned in 1948 by Ezra Pound, is a startlingly anti-Semitic fantasy of how a Jewish-led conspiracy of all-powerful
bankers established the Federal Reserve in service of their plot to dominate the world.
Part of Beck's allure is the promise that he will reveal secret information. In one segment last year, he produced a drawing
of fasces—which he described, anachronistically, as ""the Roman symbol of Fascism""—and then a picture of an old
Mercury dime, with fasces on the reverse side. ""Who brought this dime in? It happened in 1916—Woodrow Wilson was
the President,"" he said. ""We've been on the road to Fascism for a while."" Benito Mussolini, of course, didn't adopt the
ancient symbol of authority as the Fascist emblem until the nineteen-twenties; the designer of the coin, the sculptor
Adolph A. Weinman, intended it to signify the nation's military preparedness, and paired it with an olive branch to illustrate
the desire for peace.
Beck's readings of Progressive-era politics are nearly as bizarre. Whatever can be said about Theodore Roosevelt, he
was not a crypto-radical. It was Roosevelt who coined the term ""lunatic fringe"" to describe the extreme leftists of his day,
and his concept of New Nationalism—in which an activist government built a vibrant capitalism, partly by regulating big
business—looked back to Alexander Hamilton, not Karl Marx. Nor was Wilson a Bolshevik; in fact, in 1917 he sent
American troops to Russia to support the anti-Bolshevik White Army. At home, his reforms sought to break up monopolies
in order to restore competition among small companies. ""If America is not to have free enterprise,"" Wilson declared, ""then
she can have no freedom of any sort whatever.""
In 2007, Beck, then the host of ""Glenn Beck,"" on CNN's Headline News, brought to his show a John Birch Society
spokesman named Sam Antonio, who warned of a government plot to abolish U.S. borders with Mexico and Canada,
""and eventually all throughout the Americas."" Beck told Antonio, ""When I was growing up, the John Birch Society—I
thought they were a bunch of nuts."" But now, he said, ""you guys are starting to make more and more sense to me."" His
guest beamed. ""Yes, we at the John Birch Society are not nuts,"" Antonio said. ""We are just exposing the truth that's been
out there for many, many years."" Since then, the Birch Society's Web site has run clips from Beck's Fox broadcasts,
proudly pointing out similarities with their own ideas. Last June, an essay on the site described a presentation by Beck on
Communism in America as ""the ultimate in complete agreement between the Beck and JBS presentations of American
history.""
Beck has also praised Ezra Taft Benson, one of Skousen's close associates. Benson, the Secretary of Agriculture under
President Eisenhower and the thirteenth president of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, gained notoriety for
a speech in 1966 in which he denounced Democratic officeholders and intellectuals (including the historian Arthur M.
Schlesinger, Jr.) as socialists and Communist sympathizers, warned that ""the Constitution will be endangered and hang,
as it were, by a single thread,"" and praised the John Birch Society as ""the most effective non-church organization in our
fight against creeping socialism and Godless Communism."" Last June, Beck aired a clip from another Benson speech,
intoning, ""Ezra Taft Benson warned about what was coming."" The Birch Society's Web site subsequently praised Beck for
""getting progressively (sorry for the bad word choice) closer to presenting American history in the way that The John Birch
Society has been doing it for over 50 years.""

Beck is no more the sole representative of today's multifaceted Tea Party than Welch or Skousen was of the nineteen-
sixties far right; he recently told the Times, a bit disingenuously, that he was ""not involved with the Tea Party."" Why, then,
have the politics of Skousen, Benson, and the John Birch Society had such a resurgence among conservative
Republicans—not just through Beck but through Tea Party heroes like the Nevada Republican Senate candidate Sharron
Angle? (Last month, Angle gave a warm address to a ""freedom conference"" in Salt Lake City, co-sponsored by the John
Birch Society and Skousen's old group, the National Center for Constitutional Studies, praising her audience as
""mainstream America"" and patriots who had ""heard the call."") The columnist Frank Rich, among others, has suggested
that the election of a black President sowed ""fears of disenfranchisement among a dwindling and threatened minority in
the country."" There are signs that this is so: Republicans' singling out of Thurgood Marshall as an ""activist Justice"" during
Elena Kagan's Supreme Court confirmation hearings, the warnings on Fox News about the terrible dangers posed by the
minuscule New Black Panther Party. But ""socialist"" is not a racial slur. Jim Crow was not built out of fears of the Federal
Reserve and the I.R.S. The Tea Party's fulminations against cap-and-trade, federal-government bailouts, and big
government generally play on very old themes that have nothing to do with the color of President Obama's skin.
The current right-wing resurgence has more to do with the inner dynamics of American conservatism in the past half
century. In the nineteen-fifties and nineteen-sixties, the far right was condemned by liberals, as might be expected; in
November, 1961, President Kennedy devoted part of a speech in Los Angeles to denouncing those ""discordant voices of
extremism"" that ""equate the Democratic Party with the welfare state, the welfare state with socialism, and socialism with
Communism."" But the Bircher right also provoked deep anxiety among conservatives, who feared being perceived as
paranoids and conspiracy-mongers.
The leading intellectual spokesman and organizer of the anti-Bircher conservatives was William F. Buckley, Jr., the editor
of National Review. Buckley was by no means moderate in his conservatism. He was a lifelong defender of Joseph
McCarthy and a foe of New Deal liberalism. But he drew the line at claiming that the course of American government was
set by a socialist conspiracy, and he feared that the ravings of the extreme right would cost more balanced, practical
conservatives their chance at national power. ""By 1961,"" his biographer John B. Judis writes, ""Buckley was beginning to
worry that with the John Birch Society growing so rapidly, the right-wing upsurge in the country would take an ugly, even
Fascist turn rather than leading toward the kind of conservatism National Review had promoted."" In the next two decades,
with Buckley's support and counsel, Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan completed a conservative revolution that
succeeded by keeping extremist elements far from the centers of power.
As confidant and adviser to leading conservative politicians, Buckley had far more political influence than might be
expected from the editor of a weekly journal. Yet in the early nineteen-sixties he found fighting the Birchers and their
fellow-travellers extremely difficult. Even though some of Buckley's colleagues at National Review thought that the Birch
Society went too far, they would not attack the society publicly, for fear of alienating both the Birchers and the
conservatives who sympathized with their views. When Buckley wrote an editorial in 1962 that accused Welch of
""distorting reality"" and failing to make ""the crucial moral and political distinction"" between Communists and liberals, the
magazine immediately lost subscriptions and financial support.
By 1960, Senator Barry Goldwater, of Arizona, was emerging as the great political hope of conservative Republicans, and
he consulted closely with Buckley. At a meeting at the Breakers hotel, in Palm Beach, in January, 1962, Buckley urged
Goldwater to repudiate the Birch Society. Goldwater demurred; though he conceded that some embarrassing ""kooks""
lurked among the Birchers, he insisted to Buckley that there were also some ""nice guys,"" and that it would be injudicious
to attack the group in public. The Birchers' support helped gain Goldwater the Republican Presidential nomination in
1964, and he winked at them in his acceptance speech with his famous line: ""Extremism in the defense of liberty is no
vice. . . . Moderation in the pursuit of justice is no virtue.""
In the general election, though, Goldwater suffered a crushing loss to Lyndon Johnson, partly because Democrats
succeeded in making him look like a captive of the loony right. (To the Goldwater slogan ""In Your Heart, You Know He's
Right,"" the Democrats shot back, ""In Your Guts, You Know He's Nuts."") Buckley's fears had been confirmed. But he was
undeterred in his efforts to build a respectable and viable conservative movement. In 1967, he favored Richard Nixon
among a field of Republican aspirants. He liked Ronald Reagan's politics, but considered Reagan, who had only recently
been elected the governor of California, too new to national politics. George Romney, the governor of Michigan, a wishy-
washy moderate, was obviously unsuitable, to say nothing of the Republican archliberal Nelson Rockefeller, of New York.
Nixon was a hard-nosed Republican with strong conservative views, especially on Communism and the Cold War; he had
established himself as a Communist-hunter in the nineteen-forties by pressing the charge that Alger Hiss, a former official
at the State Department, had spied for the Soviets. And, promisingly, Nixon was the front-runner. ""It seems to me that we
ought to have a real chance of winning this year,"" Buckley wrote to Goldwater around the time of the Republican National
Convention. He served the campaign as an adviser, and by aiding his friend Frank Shakespeare, who had taken charge
of Nixon's media operations.
But Buckley's candidate had a reputation for shiftiness that made him unpopular across the political spectrum. Some of
the editors of National Review, recalling that Nixon had cut a deal with Rockefeller in order to secure the G.O.P.
nomination in 1960, didn't sufficiently trust him. And the Birch Society had nothing but contempt for the figure whom
Welch had called one of ""the slipperiest politicians that ever showed up on the American scene."" As President, in 1969,
Nixon began to open diplomatic relations with Communist China, and the right wing placed him on its list of perfidious
appeasers. When he visited Beijing in 1972, even Buckley was deeply offended. But when the general election took place
later that year, with the antiwar Democratic candidate, George McGovern, voicing the country's anxieties over Vietnam,

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05772691 Date: 08/31/2015
Buckley and the mainstream of what he called ""responsible conservatism"" returned to Nixon. The purist conservatives
were left to back the third-party candidacy of John Schmitz, a Republican congressman and a member of the John Birch
Society.
Nixon won in a landslide, and the next year he appointed Buckley the American delegate to the United Nations. The
conservative pragmatists had found the way to real power. And, despite the embarrassment of Watergate, in Nixon's
second term, their strategy proved effective over time. Nixon's campaign against McGovern sharpened the Democrats'
internal divisions over civil rights and Vietnam, and, Buckley wrote, revealed that the Democrats had ""an indifference
toward national independence and a hostility toward national freedom."" Meanwhile, the Buckley mainstream, having read
the Birchers out of the conservative movement, established itself as a permanent and growing force in the Republican
Party and in national politics.
In 1976, Buckley and National Review supported Ronald Reagan's primary challenge to Nixon's successor, Gerald Ford.
After two terms as governor, Reagan had matured into what Buckley considered a nearly ideal conservative politician: a
shrewd leader as well as a man of principle. Reagan nearly succeeded in wresting the nomination from Ford,
demonstrating how formidable a national figure he had become. The Bircher right had flourished in his political bastion of
Orange County, and Reagan was adept at winning extremists' allegiance while he pursued realistic strategies. His
pragmatic side showed immediately after he finally secured the Republican nomination in 1980, when he chose the
relatively moderate George H. W. Bush, his bitter foe during the primaries, as his running mate. Though the decision
dismayed right-wing ideologues, it had two practical benefits: it instantly healed the divisions between Republican
moderates and conservatives, and it helped dampen charges from the Democrats that Reagan was a reckless right-
winger. Nobody was more pleased by Bush's selection than his fellow Skull and Bones man William F. Buckley, who
understood the political logic as clearly as Reagan had.
As President, Reagan flattered the extremists—he even delivered some admiring words about Skousen's Freemen
Institute—but he saved his political capital for his real goals: undoing the fiscal underpinnings of New Deal-style
government, and redirecting U.S. foreign policy by battling the Soviet Union and its proxies around the world. He
appointed moderates to positions of importance, as when he made James Baker III, Bush's close associate, his first chief
of staff, rather than the far more ideological Edwin Meese III, his former chief of staff from California. (As a top policy
adviser, Meese helped Reagan stack the federal bench with conservatives, but he was otherwise eclipsed by Baker and
Baker's deputy, the pragmatic Reaganite Michael Deaver, and his crusade, as Attorney General, to roll back civil-rights
legislation largely failed.) When zealots in the Administration were exposed, as in the Iran-Contra scandal, Reagan
skillfully evaded responsibility and replaced them with more centrist Republicans. And, when he recognized in Mikhail
Gorbachev a Soviet leader with whom he could undertake genuine efforts to reduce the nuclear threat, Reagan pushed
forward, ignoring the complaints that he had become, in the hard-liner Howard Phillips's phrase, ""a useful idiot for Soviet
propaganda.""
Whatever misgivings may have arisen about him on the right, Reagan achieved a dramatic conservative overhaul of the
federal tax code, a profound reconfiguring of the judiciary, and a near-victory for the West in the Cold War. From the
standpoint of the mainstream right, the only problem with his legacy was that no other Republican could come close to
matching his public appeal and political savvy. For the party of Reagan, his departure was the beginning of a long decline,
and it is the absence of a similarly totemic figure, during the past twenty years, that has allowed the current resurgence of
extremism. George H. W. Bush repelled right-wingers with his moderate tendencies—not least when, in the face of fiscal
calamity, he broke his campaign pledge not to raise taxes. Bill Clinton inspired them to an almost ecstatic series of
attacks, and though there remained enough of an older conservative establishment, personified by Senator Bob Dole, to
check some of the wildest charges, the new Republican House majority after 1994, pushed by such ideologues as Tom
DeLay and Dick Armey, had little interest in maintaining the center. They harassed Clinton, forcing an impeachment even
though polls showed that more than sixty per cent of the American people disapproved. George W. Bush seemed at first
to have a bit of Reagan's conservative charisma, but the right wing turned against him for failing to win the war in Iraq, for
his moderate position on immigration, and for spending hundreds of millions of federal dollars to combat the financial
collapse in 2008. When William F. Buckley died, during the 2008 primary season, it seemed to symbolize the end of a
conservative era. David Klinghoffer, a former literary editor at National Review, lamented that ""urbane visionaries and
builders of institutions"" such as Buckley have been replaced by media figures ""who make their money by stirring fears and
resentments."" Conservatism, Klinghoffer added, ""has undergone a shift toward demagoguery and hucksterism,"" and is
now ruled by those he called ""the crazy-cons.""
Some Republicans have tried to extend the Buckley tradition, but to little effect. The commentator David Frum, a former
speechwriter for George W. Bush, lost his job at the American Enterprise Institute after he complained about the
Republicans' obstruction of health-care reform and called the right-wing surge a threat to conservatism. In June, the
congressman Bob Inglis, of South Carolina, a tough conservative who nonetheless backed Bush's financial bailout, lost a
vicious primary fight with a right-wing insurgent named Trey Gowdy. To his amazement, Inglis was confronted on the
campaign trail by voters who were convinced that numbers on their Social Security cards indicated that a secret bank had
bought them at birth. ""And then, of course,"" he recalls, ""it turned into something about the Federal Reserve and the
Bilderbergers and all that stuff."" Not even Karl Rove can afford open dissent with the Tea Partiers. Appearing on Fox
News the night of the recent primaries, he described the Tea Party-backed Senate candidate in Delaware, Christine
O'Donnell, as probably unelectable and said that some of her statements were ""nutty."" Instantly, criticism came from
Sarah Palin, Rush Limbaugh, and other right-wing Republicans. Within days, he was back on Fox, proclaiming himself ""a
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05772691 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05772691 Date: 08/31/2015
huge Tea Party fan,"" endorsing O'Donnell, and affirming that the National Republican Senatorial Committee would give
her its full backing.
So far, Rove, an unlikely dissident, is the only prominent Republican leader to so much as gesture at stepping forward, as
Buckley and his allies did. Even strong conservatives like Inglis have been pushed aside, as have such former G.O.P.
stalwarts as Charlie Crist, in Florida, and Mike Castle, in Delaware, both beaten in the primaries by Tea Party candidates;
Grist is now running a long-shot campaign as an Independent. Desperate for gains in the midterm elections, the
Republicans are neglecting the struggle it took to make politics safe for Reagan.
Fifty years ago, President Kennedy deplored the far right's ""counsels of fear and suspicion."" Today, Obama's White
House is still struggling to make sense of its enemies. In the absence of forthright leadership, on both the right and the
left, the job of standing up to extremists appears to have been left to the electorate. Candidates like O'Donnell may prove
too eccentric to prevail, or voters may simply become disillusioned by politicians who campaign on their hatred of
government. After the election, mainstream conservatives may well engage in what Richard Viguerie has forecast as ""a
massive, almost historic battle for the heart and soul of the Republican Party."" (Already, Rove and some leading Bush
political operatives, including the former Republican National Committee chairman Ed Gillespie, have been quietly
supplanting the battered G.O.P. establishment in the effort to raise funds for this year's candidates.) But, according to a
recent poll, more than seventy per cent of Republicans support the Tea Party, and it seems almost certain that a
Republican Party that has unstintingly appeased the far right will enjoy a strong and perhaps smashing victory in the
coming midterm elections.
In 1906, early in the Progressive era, the humorist Finley Peter Dunne's fictional barroom sage, Mr. Dooley, put the social
and political tumult of the day into perspective. ""Th' noise ye hear is not th' first gun iv a revolution,"" Dooley remarked. ""It's
on'y th' people iv th' United States batin' a carpet."" A century from now, or even a year from now, Americans may say the
same about the Tea Party. For the moment, though, it appears that the extreme right wing is on the verge of securing a
degree of power over Congress and the Republican Party that is unprecedented in modern American history. For
defenders of national cohesion and tempered adversity in our politics, it is an alarming state of affairs. •

Bringing Up Boehner <http://www.huffingtonpost.com/drew-westen/post 1034 b 755497.html>
According to news reports, today Republican minority leader and Coppertone model
John Boehner will give his ""closing argument"" to the American people on why they
should throw out the Democrats and kill the Obama-Pelosi-Reid ""job-killing
agenda."" He will be returning to his working class roots, speaking at a piping
manufacturing plant, an unusual venue these days for a man who is seen much more
frequently at gatherings of Wall Street executives with open checkbooks and the
males-only country club where he works on his tan when not making the rounds at
other clubs with industry lobbyists.
Either the Speaker-to-be is following the model of Michael Steele and
free-lancing, or Karl Rove and the Republicans believe it is safe or even
advantageous to bring him out in public after the White House made an effort to
put Boehner's face on what a Republican majority might look like, with the
president invoking his name eight times in one speech.
I have to admit that at the time I was agnostic as to whether it made sense to
try to brand him at this late date, as Boehner has minimal name recognition
among voters. But the White House was no doubt responding to three realities.
First, Boehner is an unknown to most Americans, which means that, unlike most
Republicans in the news, he has not been well branded by the GOP -- which means
for once Democrats might actually brand someone or something first rather than
playing catch-up. Second, Boehner would indeed be the highest-ranking Republican
were the GOP to assume control over the House (other than of course Karl Rove,
who is now directing traffic on the right side of the street in Washington
again). And third, a concrete face is always better than an abstraction when
telling a story, and other than perhaps Sarah Palin, who Republicans could
alternately accept and decline as the leader of their party, Boehner's tanned
visage and history as errand-boy for virtually every major corporate special
interest in his two decades in Washington (including his stint as the Marlboro
Man, handing out tobacco lobby campaign checks to his fellow Republicans on the
floor of the House) made him a potential counter-villain to the Republican's
bogeywoman, Nancy Pelosi.
I remained agnostic until this week, when colleagues at Media Matters Action
Network and I conducted a national messaging survey
<http://cloudfront.mediamattersaction.org/static/images/pdf/BrandingBoehner.pdf>
with 1,000 registered voters, selected to match the demographics of the voting
and likely voting populations. The goal was to see how effectively we could
speak with voters about Boehner as not only the symbol and standard-bearer for
the GOP but also the water-boy for corporate America. (The results were
surprisingly similar whether we looked at registered voters or likely voters,
although as others have described, precisely how to determine who is a ""likely
voter"" in this election is as much art as science, and the point of good
messaging at this point is actually to change the dynamics of likely voting, not
just to reflect them.)
As detailed in a memo published in Politico, what we found was clear: Boehner is
a target well worth defining, who readily stands for precisely what Americans
perceive to be the reasons they would have to hold their noses to vote for
Congressional Republicans (perhaps the only group left who poll worse than
Congressional Democrats with swing voters). We tested both paragraph-length
narratives and single-sentence language designed to capture the essence of those
narratives, and in each case, we tested them against the toughest opposition
language we could test them against: the words of Boehner, Cantor, Limbaugh and
others combined in defining the ""Obama-Pelosi-Reid"" agenda.
What we found, in brief, is that we could beat a tough GOP narrative about the
""job-killing"" socialists in the White House and Congress by 15 to 20 points with
two narratives starring Boehner in the leading role (with best supporting bad

actor going in one of the narratives to Karl Rove and his corporate allies), and
we could win with over 15 different sentence-long descriptions of ""what's the
matter with Boehner"" with margins ranging from 10 to 60 points against a tough
conservative attack on the Obama-Pelosi-Reid axis of conservative evil.
The narratives that most moved likely voters -- including swing voters, who
preferred them by double-digits over tough Republican rhetoric -- made clear
whose voices Boehner would be speaking for as Speaker (e.g., the Wall Street
executives he convened to try to block Wall Street reform). They harnessed the
same populist anger at the hijacking of Washington by corporate special
interests that has enlivened the tea partiers and is palpable across the
political spectrum, and they focused on the extremism of the party Boehner would
Speak for. A narrative that brought Karl Rove into the picture was slightly more
polarizing with swing voters but slightly more powerful with likely Democratic
voters.
In some ways what was most surprising was the success of the single-line
statements of what we need in a Speaker and who John Boehner really speaks for
(although these single-line statements came after the narratives, and likely
reflect the power of branding, even over the course of a brief online encounter
with voters). They ranged from relatively lofty and aspirational (e.g., ""We need
a Speaker who is also a listener, who can hear the voices of ordinary Americans""
-- a theme colleagues and I found highly resonant across the political spectrum
in message testing on the role of money in politics) -- to the harder-edged
(e.g., ""The Speaker of the House is a heartbeat away from the Presidency.
Unfortunately, we know where John Boehner's heart is, and it isn't with the
middle class,"" or ""John Boehner understands deficits. He's spent nearly 20 years
in Washington creating them."")
If there's a message in this message research, it is at once short-term and
long-term. In the short run, if Democrats want to hang onto their seats in
November, they would do well to define this election in terms of the middle
class and small business versus the billionaires and big corporations that are
hijacking our democracy; to use Boehner as a poster child for the party whose
primary commitment is to the latter and whose tan is a testament to that
commitment; and to avoid giving voters reason to regret their vote if they give
it to Democrats again this time, by supporting the things they say they stand
for and avoiding that golden mean between the public interest and the special
interests that finance campaigns on both sides of the aisle.
In the longer run, branding matters. One of the biggest strategic and messaging
mistakes of the last two years was the failure of Democrats to brand their
opponents while their opponents were busy branding them -- and in particular the
failure to brand the Bush Recession as the natural consequence of failed
Republican economic principles. Two years ago, that was a virtually uncontested
political proposition, as the voters made clear in handing Democrats the White
House and supermajorities in both the House and Senate. Today, the public is
split down the middle as to who caused the recession.
Reality doesn't brand itself. Hopefully it won't take a. debacle in November and
another 10 million jobs lost for reality to unveil itself again for a brief
political moment and for progressives to have a second bite at the apple.

Thought you might be interested in this piece by Joe Nye which I believe validates the new approach we are trying to
implement. We have begun to roll-out the new plan and so far the reaction has been reasonably positive. We have
organized a set of working groups around key initiatives --- women's empowerment; cve; expanded English language
training; cultural programming; youth; climate change; etc so that we can incorporate new proposals into FY2012
budget and re-direct FY 2010 and 2011 funds wherever possible and appropriate. The working groups are being chaired
by senior level officers from the regional bureaus --- Bob Blake; Craig Kelly, etc. --- and are being asked to report back
within 4 to 6 weeks. I'll continue to keep you posted as things move forward.

CAMBRIDGE — The world of traditional power politics was typically about whose military or economy would win. In
today's information age, politics is also about whose ""story"" wins.
National narratives are, indeed, a type of currency. Governments compete with each other and with other organizations
to enhance their own credibility and weaken that of their opponents. Witness the contest between the government and
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05774001 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05774001 Date: 08/31/2015
protesters after the Iranian elections in June 2009, in which the Internet and Twitter played crucial roles, or the recent
controversy between Google and China.
Reputation has always mattered in world politics, but credibility has become crucial because of a ""paradox of plenty.""
When information is plentiful, the scarce resource is attention. Under the new conditions, a soft sell may, more than
ever, prove more effective than a hard sell.
For example, the relative independence of the BBC, sometimes a source of consternation to British governments, has
paid rich dividends in credibility, as illustrated by this account of Tanzanian President Jakaya Kikwete's day: ""he rises at
dawn, listens to the BBC World Service, then scans the Tanzanian press.""
Skeptics who treat the term ""public diplomacy"" as a mere euphemism for propaganda miss the point. Simple
propaganda is counterproductive as public diplomacy. Nor is public diplomacy merely a public-relations campaign. Public
diplomacy also involves building long-term relationships that create an enabling environment for government policies.
The contribution of direct government information to long-term cultural relationships varies with three dimensions or
stages of public diplomacy, and all three are important. The first and most immediate dimension is daily
communications, which involves explaining the context of domestic and foreign-policy decisions. This dimension also
involves preparation for dealing with crises. If there is a vacuum in information after an event, others will rush in to fill it.
The second dimension is strategic communication, which develops a set of simple themes, much as a political or
advertising campaign does. While the first dimension is measured in hours and days, the second occurs over weeks,
months, and even years.
The third dimension of public diplomacy is the development of lasting relationships with key individuals over many years
or even decades, through scholarships, exchanges, training, seminars, conferences, and access to media channels. These
programs develop what the American journalist Edward R. Murrow once called the crucial ""last three feet"" — face-to-
face communications, with the enhanced credibility that reciprocity creates.
But even the best advertising cannot sell an unpopular product. A communications strategy cannot work if it cuts against
the grain of policy. Actions speak louder than words. All too often, policymakers treat public diplomacy as a bandage
that can be applied after damage is done by other instruments. For example, China tried to enhance its soft power by
successfully staging the 2008 Olympics, but its domestic simultaneous crackdown in Tibet — and subsequent repression
in Xinxiang and arrests of human rights lawyers — undercut its gains.
Great powers try to use culture and narrative to create soft power that promotes their advantage, but they do not
always understand how to do it. Critics in the United States complain that the over-militarization of foreign policy
undercuts its credibility. Instead, they advocate diplomacy ""on steroids,"" staffed by diplomats trained in new media,
cross-cultural communications, granular local knowledge, and networks of contacts with under-represented groups.
The centralized mass-media approach to public diplomacy still plays an important role. Governments need to correct
daily misrepresentations of their policies, as well as to try to convey a longer-term strategic message. The main strength
of the mass-media approach is its audience reach and ability to generate public awareness and set the agenda. But its
weakness is its inability to influence how the message is perceived in different cultural settings. The sender knows what
she says, but not always what the targets hear. Cultural barriers are apt to distort what is heard.
Networked communications, on the other hand, can take advantage of two-way communications and peer-to-peer
relations to overcome cultural differences. This type of decentralization and flexibility is difficult for governments to
accomplish, given their central accountability structures.
The greater flexibility of non-governmental organizations in using networks has given rise to what some call ""the new
public diplomacy,"" which is no longer confined to messaging, promotion campaigns, or even direct governmental
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05774001 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05774001 Date: 08/31/2015
contacts with foreign publics serving foreign-policy purposes. It is also about building relationships with civil-society
actors in other countries and facilitating networks between non-governmental parties at home and abroad.
In this approach to public diplomacy, government policy is aimed at promoting and participating in, rather than
controlling, such cross-border networks. Indeed, too much government control, or even the appearance of it, can
undercut the credibility that such networks are designed to engender. The evolution of public diplomacy from one-way
communications to a two-way dialogue treats publics as co-creators of meaning and communication.
Power in a global information age, more than ever, will include a soft dimension of attraction as well as the hard
dimensions of coercion and payment. Combining these dimensions effectively is called ""smart power."" For example, the
current struggle against transnational terrorism is a struggle over winning hearts and minds, and over-reliance on hard
power alone is not the path to success.
Public diplomacy is an important tool in the arsenal of smart power, but smart public diplomacy requires an
understanding of credibility, self-criticism, and the role of civil society in generating soft power. If it degenerates into
propaganda, public diplomacy not only fails to convince, but can undercut soft power. Instead, it must remain a two-way
process, because soft power depends, first and foremost, upon understanding the minds of others.

it is still the right thing to do and to continue (Humanitarian/Security both addressed). He also spoke directly to the
bipartisan nature of the program (from inception) and the need to continue bipartisan support. It was a missed

I get these reports every morning. They are somewhat painful to read since, as you know, in Pakistan, the media can be
particularly outrageous. However, we can't ignore the fact that these talk shows are the most watched programming in
prime time.. The report below is fairly typical. The host sets up the discussion in fairly provocative way and the guests,
who come from across the political spectrum, respond. As you can see, the first commentator is strongly anti US.
However, what I have observed since our media offensive began last Fall is that there is usually a more moderate guest
as well, who will argue along the lines that it is only natural for the US to protect its interests and GOP should do a better
job of protecting Pakistan. Believe it or not there have even been instances where we get credit for some of the things
we do. Also on occasion where there have been particularly egregious attacks on US policy, the host will read a
statement from our Embassy in the following programming. We try to get airtime on these programs whenever
possible but it is hard. It 's a hard slog getting this right but we are making progress.

the role of a frontline state in the war against terrorism while, on the other, it has signed nuclear deal with our worst
enemy, India. What, in your opinion, is the real U.S. agenda in our region?
Munawwar Hassan: The U.S. wants to make India the mini-superpower in this region. This American policy prompted the
Indian army chief to boast that his country can fight against China and Pakistan simultaneously. The U.S. needs our
cooperation against Iran and China. It also wants our help to occupy the resources of the Central Asian states. The
current wave of extremism in the region is the reaction of imperialistic policies of Washington. Despite our recognition
of the Taliban government in Afghanistan, Pakistan treated their ambassador in Islamabad in a very humiliating manner.
In fact, our rulers have becomes the slaves of the United States. But Pakistan will get nothing by befriending the U.S. and
helping Americans in their conspiracies against our neighbors. The history tells us that Washington's enmity is
dangerous, and its friendship is fatal.
Shahid Amin: Every country devises its policies to safeguard its national interests and same is true for the United States.
However, it is the responsibility of our governments to protect Pakistan's interests while dealing with Americans. Today,
the Taliban and Al-Qaeda constitute the biggest threat to the U.S. security. But these terrorist organizations also pose a
potential threat to the security and integrity of Pakistan. Hence, like America, their elimination is also in our own
national interest.

Why Obama Is Losing the Political War
By Mark Halperin
Barack Obama is being politically crushed in a vise. From above, by elite opinion about his competence. From below, by
mass anger and anxiety over unemployment. And it is too late for him to do anything about this predicament until after
November's elections.
With the exception of core Obama Administration loyalists, most politically engaged elites have reached the same
conclusions: the White House is in over its head, isolated, insular, arrogant and clueless about how to get along with or
persuade members of Congress, the media, the business community or working-class voters. This view is held by Fox
News pundits, executives and anchors at the major old-media outlets, reporters who cover the White House, Democratic
and Republican congressional leaders and governors, many Democratic business people and lawyers who raised big
money for Obama in 2008, and even some members of the Administration just beyond the inner circle. (See Obama's
troubled first year, issue by issue.)
On Friday, after the release of the latest bleak unemployment data — the last major jobs figures before the midterms —
Obama said, ""Putting the American people back to work, expanding opportunity, rebuilding the economic security of the
middle class is the moral and national challenge of our time."" But elites feel the President has failed to meet that challenge
and are convinced he will be unable to do so in the remainder of his term. Moreover, there is a growing perception that
Obama's decisions are causing harm — that businesses are being hurt by the Administration's legislation and that
economic recovery is stalling because of the uncertainty surrounding energy policy, health care, deficits, housing,
immigration and spending.
And that sentiment is spreading. Many members of the general public appear deeply skeptical of Obama's capacity to turn
things around, especially, but not exclusively, those inclined to dislike him — Tea Partyers and John McCain voters, but
also tens of millions of middle-class Americans, including quite a few who turned out for Obama in 2008. (See how some
Americans are facing the prospect of long-term unemployment.)
The misery afflicting the country has no political affiliation. Listen to the voices from this striking TV ad for Rob Portman,
the Republican former Congressman and Bush budget director who is running for Senate from Ohio. One woman at a
Dayton career fair says starkly, ""There are no jobs."" A man announces plaintively and with obvious frustration, ""I've been
looking for a job now for 13 months."" Events like this job fair are becoming the grim iconic gatherings of our time, the
breadlines for the Obama years.
Most of Obama's private (and sometimes public) rebuttals to the voices slamming him on all sides are justified or spot on.
He did inherit a lot of problems from the Bush Administration. He did act quickly in the initial weeks of his Administration to
stave off a worldwide depression. His efforts at job creation have been obstructed by Republicans (even the proposals
based on policies supported by the GOP in the past). His opponents haven't put forth specifics of their own, nor offered
genuine compromise, while the media have allowed the right's activists and gabbers to run wild with criticism without
furnishing legitimate alternative solutions. (See Barack Obama's top 10 sound bites.)
But Obama has exacerbated his political problems not just by failing to enact policies that would have actually turned the
economy around, but also by authorizing a series of tactical moves intended to demonize Republicans and distract from
the problems at hand. He has wasted time lambasting his foes when he should have been putting forth his agenda in a
clear, optimistic fashion, defending the benefits of his key decisions during the past two years (health care and the
Troubled Asset Relief Program, for example) and explaining what he would do with a re-elected Democratic majority to
spur growth.
Throughout the year, we have been treated to Obama-led attacks on George W. Bush and Dick Cheney, Rush Limbaugh,
Congressman Joe Barton (for his odd apology to BP), John Boehner (for seeking the speakership — or was it something
about an ant?) and Fox News (for everything). Suitable Democratic targets in some cases, perhaps, but not worth the time
of a busy Commander in Chief. In the past few days, we have witnessed the spectacle of the President himself and his
top advisers wading into allegations that Republicans are attempting to buy the election using foreign money laundered
through the Chamber of Commerce, combining with Karl Rove and his wealthy backers to fund a flood of negative
television commercials. Not only is this issue convoluted and far-fetched, but it also distracts from the issues voters care
about, frustrating political insiders and alienating struggling citizens (not that many are following such an offbeat story
line). Feinting and gibing can't obscure those job numbers. (See the best viral campaign ads of 2010.)
The President and Democrats have passed many significant measures (the stimulus spending, the auto-company rescue,
the health care law and the financial regulation effort) that someday may be seen as brave and bold, the foundation for a
better economy. Obama and his closest aides certainly think that will happen. But the President was correct when he said
Friday, ""the only piece of economic news that folks still looking for work want to hear is, 'You're hired,"" and that's still not
occurring for too many Americans.
The politically good news for Obama is that no matter what the outcome of the midterm elections, everything changes in
January. Republicans will have a greater obligation, politically and morally, to help govern, rather than thwart and badger.
The President will get a chance, in his State of the Union address and in his budget proposal, to show he is turning the
page on the political horrors of 2010 for his party and the nation. But before then, Republicans are almost certainly going
to demonstrate that you can beat something with nothing, especially when Americans seem to think that the Obama
Administration hasn't much to offer either, except more of the same that isn't working.

economic recovery is stalling because of the uncertainty surrounding energy policy, health care, deficits, housing,
immigration and spending.
And that sentiment is spreading. Many members of the general public appear deeply skeptical of Obama's capacity to turn
things around, especially, but not exclusively, those inclined to dislike him — Tea Partyers and John McCain voters, but
also tens of millions of middle-class Americans, including quite a few who turned out for Obama in 2008. (See how some
Americans are facing the prospect of long-term unemployment.)
The misery afflicting the country has no political affiliation. Listen to the voices from this striking TV ad for Rob Portman,
the Republican former Congressman and Bush budget director who is running for Senate from Ohio. One woman at a
Dayton career fair says starkly, ""There are no jobs."" A man announces plaintively and with obvious frustration, ""I've been
looking for a job now for 13 months."" Events like this job fair are becoming the grim iconic gatherings of our time, the
breadlines for the Obama years.
Most of Obama's private (and sometimes public) rebuttals to the voices slamming him on all sides are justified or spot on.
He did inherit a lot of problems from the Bush Administration. He did act quickly in the initial weeks of his Administration to
stave off a worldwide depression. His efforts at job creation have been obstructed by Republicans (even the proposals
based on policies supported by the GOP in the past). His opponents haven't put forth specifics of their own, nor offered
genuine compromise, while the media have allowed the right's activists and gabbers to run wild with criticism without
furnishing legitimate alternative solutions. (See Barack Obama's top 10 sound bites.)
But Obama has exacerbated his political problems not just by failing to enact policies that would have actually turned the
economy around, but also by authorizing a series of tactical moves intended to demonize Republicans and distract from
the problems at hand. He has wasted time lambasting his foes when he should have been putting forth his agenda in a
clear, optimistic fashion, defending the benefits of his key decisions during the past two years (health care and the
Troubled Asset Relief Program, for example) and explaining what he would do with a re-elected Democratic majority to
spur growth.

Throughout the year, we have been treated to Obama-led attacks on George W. Bush and Dick Cheney, Rush Limbaugh,
Congressman Joe Barton (for his odd apology to BP), John Boehner (for seeking the speakership — or was it something
about an ant?) and Fox News (for everything). Suitable Democratic targets in some cases, perhaps, but not worth the time
of a busy Commander in Chief. In the past few days, we have witnessed the spectacle of the President himself and his
top advisers wading into allegations that Republicans are attempting to buy the election using foreign money laundered
through the Chamber of Commerce, combining with Karl Rove and his wealthy backers to fund a flood of negative
television commercials. Not only is this issue convoluted and far-fetched, but it also distracts from the issues voters care
about, frustrating political insiders and alienating struggling citizens (not that many are following such an offbeat story
line). Feinting and gibing can't obscure those job numbers. (See the best viral campaign ads of 2010.)
The President and Democrats have passed many significant measures (the stimulus spending, the auto-company rescue,
the health care law and the financial regulation effort) that someday may be seen as brave and bold, the foundation for a
better economy. Obama and his closest aides certainly think that will happen. But the President was correct when he said
Friday, ""the only piece of economic news that folks still looking for work want to hear is, 'You're hired,"" and that's still not
occurring for too many Americans.
The politically good news for Obama is that no matter what the outcome of the midterm elections, everything changes in
January. Republicans will have a greater obligation, politically and morally, to help govern, rather than thwart and badger.
The President will get a chance, in his State of the Union address and in his budget proposal, to show he is turning the
page on the political horrors of 2010 for his party and the nation. But before then, Republicans are almost certainly going
to demonstrate that you can beat something with nothing, especially when Americans seem to think that the Obama
Administration hasn't much to offer either, except more of the same that isn't working.

Bringing Up Boehner <http://www.huffingtonpost.com/drew-westen/post 1034 b 755497.html>
According to news reports, today Republican minority leader and Coppertone model
John Boehner will give his ""closing argument"" to the American people on why they
should throw out the Democrats and kill the Obama-Pelosi-Reid ""job-killing
agenda."" He will be returning to his working class roots, speaking at a piping
manufacturing plant, an unusual venue these days for a man who is seen much more
frequently at gatherings of Wall Street executives with open checkbooks and the
males-only country club where he works on his tan when not making the rounds at
other clubs with industry lobbyists.
Either the Speaker-to-be is following the model of Michael Steele and
free-lancing, or Karl Rove and the Republicans believe it is safe or even
advantageous to bring him out in public after the White House made an effort to
put Boehner's face on what a Republican majority might look like, with the
president invoking his name eight times in one speech:
I have to admit that at the time I was agnostic as to whether it made sense to
try to brand him at this late date, as Boehner has minimal name recognition
among voters. But the White House was no doubt responding to three realities.
First, Boehner is an unknown to most Americans, which means that, unlike most
Republicans in the news, he has not been well branded by the GOP -- which means
for once Democrats might actually brand someone or something first rather than
playing catch-up. Second, Boehner would indeed be the highest-ranking Republican
were the GOP to assume control over the House (other than of course Karl Rove,
who is now directing traffic on the right side of the street in Washington
again). And third, a concrete face is always better than an abstraction when
telling a story, and other than perhaps Sarah Palin, who Republicans could
alternately accept and decline as the leader of their party, Boehner's tanned
visage and history as errand-boy for virtually every major corporate special
interest in his two decades in Washington (including his stint as the Marlboro
Man, handing out tobacco lobby campaign checks to his fellow Republicans on the
floor of the House) made him a potential counter-villain to the Republican's
bogeywoman, Nancy Pelosi.
I remained agnostic until this week, when colleagues at Media Matters Action
Network and I conducted a national messaging survey
<http://cloudfront.mediamattersaction.org/static/images/pdf/BrandingBoehner.pdf>
with 1,000 registered voters, selected to match the demographics of the voting
and likely voting populations. The goal was to see how effectively we could
speak with voters about Boehner as not only the symbol and standard-bearer for
the GOP but also the water-boy for corporate America. (The results were
surprisingly similar whether we looked at registered voters or likely voters,
although as others have described, precisely how to determine who is a ""likely
voter"" in this election is as much art as science, and the point of good
messaging at this point is actually to change the dynamics of likely voting, not
just to reflect them.)
As detailed in a memo published in Politico, what we found was clear: Boehner is
a target well worth defining, who readily stands for precisely what Americans
perceive to be the reasons they would have to hold their noses to vote for
Congressional Republicans (perhaps the only group left who poll worse than
Congressional Democrats with swing voters). We tested both paragraph-length
narratives and single-sentence language designed to capture the essence of those
narratives, and in each case, we tested them against the toughest opposition
language we could test them against: the words of Boehner, Cantor, Limbaugh and
others combined in defining the ""Obama-Pelosi-Reid"" agenda.
What we found, in brief, is that we could beat a tough GOP narrative about the
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05772693 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05772693 Date: 08/31/2015
""job-killing"" socialists in the White House and Congress by 15 to 20 points with
two narratives starring Boehner in the leading role (with best supporting bad
actor going in one of the narratives to Karl Rove and his corporate allies), and
we could win with over 15 different sentence-long descriptions of ""what's the
matter with Boehner"" with margins ranging from 10 to 60 points against a tough
conservative attack on the Obama-Pelosi-Reid axis of conservative evil.
The narratives that most moved likely voters -- including swing voters, who
preferred them by double-digits over tough Republican rhetoric -- made clear
whose voices Boehner would be speaking for as Speaker (e.g., the Wall Street
executives he convened to try to block Wall Street reform). They harnessed the
same populist anger at the hijacking of Washington by corporate special
interests that has enlivened the tea partiers and is palpable across the
political spectrum, and they focused on the extremism of the party Boehner would
Speak for. A narrative that brought Karl Rove into the picture was slightly more
polarizing with swing voters but slightly more powerful with likely Democratic
voters.
In some ways what was most surprising was the success of the single-line
statements of what we need in a Speaker and who John Boehner really speaks for
(although these single-line statements came after the narratives, and likely
reflect the power of branding, even over the course of a brief online encounter
with voters). They ranged from relatively lofty and aspirational (e.g., ""We need
a Speaker who is also a listener, who can hear the voices of ordinary Americans""
-- a theme colleagues and I found highly resonant across the political spectrum
in message testing on the role of money in politics) -- to the harder-edged
(e.g., ""The Speaker of the House is a heartbeat away from the Presidency.
Unfortunately, we know where John Boehner's heart is, and it isn't with the
middle class,"" or ""John Boehner understands deficits. He's spent nearly 20 years
in Washington creating them."")
If there's a message in this message research, it is at once short-term and
long-term. In the short run, if Democrats want to hang onto their seats in
November, they would do well to define this election in terms of the middle
class and small business versus the billionaires and big corporations that are
hijacking our democracy; to use Boehner as a poster child for the party whose
primary commitment is to the latter and whose tan is a testament to that
commitment; and to avoid giving voters reason to regret their vote if they give
it to Democrats again this time, by supporting the things they say they stand
for and avoiding that golden mean between the public interest and the special
interests that finance campaigns on both sides of the aisle.
In the longer run, branding matters. One of the biggest strategic and messaging
mistakes of the last two years was the failure of Democrats to brand their
opponents while their opponents were busy branding them -- and in particular the
failure to brand the Bush Recession as the natural consequence of failed
Republican economic principles. Two years ago, that was a virtually uncontested
political proposition, as the voters made clear in handing Democrats the White
House and supermajorities in both the House and Senate. Today, the public is
split down the middle as to who caused the recession.
Reality doesn't brand itself. Hopefully it won't take a debacle in November and
another 10 million jobs lost for reality to unveil itself again for a brief
. political moment and for progressives to have a second bite at the apple.

JALALABAD (AFP) — A Taliban-style bomb attack killed a district governor in eastern Afghanistan on October 22, police
said. Khorsheed, the governor of Dur Baba in Nangarhar province, was driving to work when the improvised-explosive
device often used in insurgent attacks blew up his vehicle, said police spokesman Colonel Abdul Ghafour. Like many
Afghans, the official had only one name. ""The district governor has been martyred. Three other people, his driver and
guards have been injured,"" Ghafour told AFP. He could not say who was behind the attack, but the tactics were typical
of the Taliban.

David was for many years the president of the New World Foundation. During that period the
Secretary served on the board of the foundation and worked with David. His family would like the Secretary to be
informed of David's death. Incidentally when I worked at the NSC I walked David over to the White House for a private

Hi Cheryl:
Today, I was able to have good preliminary conversations with Jean Bonilla and Lorraine Hariton in EEB. Both Jean and
Lorraine are very excited about the opportunity to partner on this new area for the Secretary and provided me with
some very valuable insight and discussion on how we can partner and collaborate on programming and initiatives
together.

I also included the information from ECA — that we discussed in the document. The INR meeting was cancelled today and
will be scheduled for early next week. As I move around the Department and talk with other officials in the coming
week, I believe we will be able to build out a more robust Work Plan and garner some great collaborations on this
effort.
Additionally, in a recent conversation that I had with Governor O'Malley from Maryland, I shared with him that the
Secretary was launching a new effort that would assist state and local leaders with respect to their global affairs
portfolios. The Governor was extremely excited and remarked that he has some great idea for the Secretary about how
the Department can be a major value-add to local governments. He told me that he wants to be very engaged in what
we do in the Department in this area. I will be scheduling a time to meet with him and his economic team once my
position has been announced. He wanted me to let her know that he had been thinking about her and wanted to reach
out and did not know how and then I walked in and we began to have this discussion and he said — what a way to start
his year for 2010 — something coming to reality that he had been thinking about.
Also, Maura Pally in ECA forwarded me a meeting that I took with the Deputy Director of the National Lieutenant
Governor's Association. They were in town working on their upcoming Washington meeting. They too are very excited
about what we are planning and want to work very closely with us in the coming months as we launch this effort. Lt.
Governor Bill Bolling in VA is the current Chair.
Please let me know if you need to make any additional changes. Thanks so much for all of your assistance and
support!!!
Have a great New Years!!

TOWARD A NEW POLICY ON IRAN
BY HEINTZ, LUERS, PICKERING AND WISNER
December 21, 2010
I INTRODUCTION: US-Iran relations are never ripe for an opening
but there is high risk to continuing to put it off. We propose that you
urge the President to instruct you to open a direct relationship with
Iran. That might begin by a letter of congratulations to Foreign
Minister Salehi offering to work with him toward a new relationship.
The burden rests on the US to convince an uncertain Iranian leadership
to come out of its shell. The next few months offer an opportune moment
for a new policy. The 2010 sanctions are taking a toll on Iran but are not
changing Iran's behavior. The Iranian government has moved in a more
repressive direction against the opposition and for consolidation of
Khamenei/Ahmadinej ad power, with an increasing role of the Iranian
Revolutionary Guard.
The Administration has a responsibility and an opportunity now to take
initiatives in 2011 that will diminish the possibility of conflict and enhance
the US role in the Middle East We try to answer below: Why now? What
are the elements of a new policy? How to get started?
II Why Now?
A. The Administration's 2009 moves to reset US policy in the
Middle East and the Islamic world have been well received by
most Islamic nations but undercut by Iran. A US policy of
isolating Iran is comforting and easier than alternatives but it also
weakens the larger US objectives of resetting our role in the region. A
new US policy toward Iran would enhance the administration's
regional strategy and return the US to being a strategic player rather
than a polarizing one.
B. The President's initiatives to engage Iran last year failed. The
Iranian expectations for corrective actions from the Obama
administration have been high. Iran's self image as an aggrieved

victim of the US perfidy and efforts at regime change, provide a
partial explanation for the Iranian unresponsiveness. Another factor
has been Iran's domestic turmoil, almost unprecedented since the
1979 revolution. As a result the leadership has been even more
immobilized than usual on whether and under what conditions to meet
with American officials. Now is the time to return with even greater
authority in an effort to talk to the Iranians (C below). EV-Ily novt-isit ,--

C. Significant US steps toward engagement now would surprise
Iran's leaders. A new policy now would be more effective in
changing Iranian behavior than the sanctions have been. The
multilateral agreements in 2010 to strengthen the sanctions against
Iran have sent a strong message to the Iranian leadership about the
seriousness of the Obama administration. But the sanctions have also
reinforced Iran's determination to stay the course. Iran's leaders
perceive US policies over the past 30 years of seeking to isolate,
punish, threaten, subvert, sanction, intimidate, and overthrow if
possible Iran as a permanent fixture of American foreign policy. They
have been successful in convincing the Iranian public that they are
right. Now is the time to engage the Iranians with a new and
determined US policy.
D. Failure to reach an agreement soon on Iran's nuclear program
will increase the risk that Iran will have the capacity to develop a
nuclear weapon. The decision to continue to deploy UNSC sanctions
as our ""weapon of choice"" for stopping Iran's enrichment of uranium
has failed. This policy has contributed to making Iran's nuclear
program (not a nuclear bomb) a symbol of national unity and pride.
As the UNSC approves more sanctions Iran builds more centrifuges.
This US insistence on having some suspension of enrichment or a deal
on their nuclear program as a precondition for talks on other subjects
has led both countries into a dead end. The resulting confrontation

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773680 Date: 08/31/2015
seems likely to allow Iran the time to develop a nuclear bomb and as a
result eventually toward potential conflict as the only option.
Although the US has stressed that it is following a two track policy
toward Iran, in fact the diplomatic track has been mainly in the
successful diplomatic effort to expand sanctions. A new US policy
must give Iran reasons to limit its nuclear program to peaceful
purposes. We should consider an approach that provides enrichment
in Iran under international supervision but such a discussion awaits a
US decision and must be coordinated with the other members of the
P-5.
E. The consequences of a failure in US policy toward Iran will
severely damage US interest's world wide. US military action
against Iran is unthinkable as a strategy or as the consequence of no
strategy. Military conflict would gravely set back our programs in Iraq
and Afghanistan, further derail the peace process, and perhaps lead to
a regional war involving Israel, some Arab states and Hezbollah and
Hamas. A new toll of human life in the Islamic world would be
catastrophic for the goals of resetting US policy with consequences
for US interests from Morocco to South East Asia. The consequences
of prolonging the current policy without accomplishing any of its
objectives will degrade US authority and power. Another consequence
will be the missed opportunity to engage Iran in a long term
constructive regional strategy:
1)To put in place a crisis management understanding that will
reduce the possibility of US-Iran conflict in the Gulf or over Iraq and
Afghanistan.
2) To deal directly with Iran over its nuclear program.
3) To help establish a regional security structure aimed at
giving Iran and the Gulf states a greater sense of stability.
4) To build a regional stabilization program for Afghanistan
and Iraq,
5) To carry out a joint program to reduce drug trafficking,
6) To develop a coordinated effort to deal with refugees in the
region.
7) To develop together approaches to weaken the Taliban and
destroy Qa'eda and eventually to weaken Iran's support for Hamas
and Hezbollah.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773680 Date: 08/31/2015
8) To develop other common approaches to serious issues in the
region where U.S. and Iranian interests are at play — drugs, refugees
are examples.
III WHAT ARE THE ELEMENTS OF A NEW POLICY? The US
should make a determined and carefully designed effort to get the
Iranians to the table. The risks of delaying this relationship are getting
higher. Any new policy toward Iran should begin with the following
characteristics.
A. A new policy must engender a positive decision from the
Supreme Leader and his advisors and thus must be seen to
come from the President and have his full commitment to its
implementation. It must aim in the first instance at defining a
framework of negotiations that address all outstanding issues
between the US and Iran.
B. It must eliminate suggestions to Iran that the suspension of
enrichment or some other ""progress"" on our nuclear demands
is a precondition for any progress to direct talks. The Iranians
still believe that broader talks on a full range of issues with the US
based on mutual respect and justice will only happen if Iran
suspends enrichment. This Iranian posture is partially a reflection
of their paranoia and insecurity in dealing with the US. But fruitful
discussions on nuclear issues are only likely to come after Iran has
determined that the US seriously seeks a bilateral relationship
based on mutual respect for each other's interests, concerns and
role in the region.
C. The US should achieve an arrangement with Iran that would
maximize IAEA and other international access to and
monitoring of Iran's nuclear program. As the US sets aside its
zero enrichment preconditions for any progress in the talks, it
should link Iran's assurances that it will not build a nuclear bomb
to a new agreement. That agreement should provide for intrusive
inspections from the IAEA and multilateral or international
management of their enrichment program.
D. A US offer to cooperate with Iran as an equal partner on one
or more non-nuclear issues will set the stage for more fruitful
4
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773680 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773680 Date: 08/31/2015
discussion of the nuclear issue. The US will improve markedly
chances to get Iran to deal seriously with the nuclear issues by
starting with an offer to cooperate on other problems in the region.
The Iranians do not want to ""talk"" or ""negotiate"" with the US.
Small gestures such as direct flights to Tehran from the US and
liberalizing travel restrictions on their diplomats in the US might
help but not change the situation significantly. They want to work
together with the US. The issues that would demonstrate a serious
US intention to work with Iran would be:
a. Create crisis management mechanisms to deal with the
possibility of incidents in the Gulf or in Iraq and
Afghanistan.
b. Renew the cooperation on Afghanistan (that was cut off in
January 2002).
c. Seek cooperation on Iraq (in anticipation of further US force
draw down) building on the bilateral talks that took place in
Baghdad several years ago.
d. Seek cooperation on controlling drug trafficking along the
Afghan border and more broadly.
E. Take actions that will signal to Iran's leaders that the US has
genuinely rejected a regime change strategy. Oral assurances
have not been sufficient. The Iranians have appreciated
President Obama's rhetorical outreach but argue that the
rhetoric has not been matched with any material change in US
actions. Such steps would include a decision to reduce or cease
few-a-per-led-44444w some executive branch actions taken against
Iran, particularly anvsofne covert political military activities (with
the exception of efforts to delay or disrupt their progress on
enrichment) that Iran's leaders might identify as part of the US
strategy of regime change.
F. One way to begin a new effort at engagement would be for the
Secretary of State to send a letter to the new Iranian Foreign
Minister Salehi congratulating him on his new position and
suggesting a willingness to work with him toward a new era in
US-Iranian relations. Such a letter might be delivered directly
through the Iranian Permanent Representative to the United

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773680 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773680 Date: 08/31/2015
Nations along with the oral message to the Supreme Leader that
we recommend below.
G. Set a new tone in reciprocal communications including a
moratorium on the rhetorical attacks from leaders on both
sides. The President and cabinet members would constrain their
threats and red lines on Iranian behavior, make clear at every
opportunity that the US does not have a policy of regime change
and agree to open up the entire range of bilateral issues that are
particularly important to the Iranians. Astute subtle gestures on
both sides can diminish the distrust. The Iranian leadership would
be asked to agree to comparable restraint in relation to the US. Our
overall goal is to secure Iranian recognition that we are legitimate
players in the region, have interests and will defend them. At the
same time, we will not seek to destabilize Iran's domestic order.
We can compete peacefully on the playing field of ideas, without
challenging the legitimacy of each other's interests.
H. Establish a formal structure through which the two
governments will communicate directly. But diplomatic
relations should not be sought at the outset. One early priority
will be for both sides to empower a senior representative to
conduct regular discussions on official business. Key
communications should go through one established channel, agree
to avoid informal back channels, and seek progressively to raise
the level of those authorized officials. Each side will want to
establish a bilateral process to manage the multiple bilateral
incidents and problems such as arrested nationals and travel of
Iranian diplomats at the UN. Iranian officials have underscored
their reluctance to establish diplomatic relations for now since they
have a long history of distrust for the purposes and activities of a
US Embassy in Tehran.
IV. HOW TO GET STARTED?
A. The President must find a way to communicate directly
with the Supreme Leader a US desire to open official talks.
6
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773680 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773680 Date: 08/31/2015
Further written communications alone from the President will
not persuade the Leader that the US is serious this time.
Getting directly to the Leader with an oral message (perhaps
confirmed by a non-paper), delivered at a very senior level, is
important to get through despiteafound the intense internal
political struggles in Tehran over relations with the US — and
over who will rule Iran.
The message to the Leader should declare that President
Obama has designated his personal representative to conduct
official discussions with a representative of the Supreme
Leader. In a respectful tone the message should call for:
• The avoidance of misunderstandings in the
Gulf, Afghanistan, Iraq or the Levant that
would lead to conflict.
• Greater cooperation between these two
important states — the US and Iran - in the
Middle East.
• Mutual recognition of the other's legitimate
interests in the area.
• The beginning, without preconditions, of
discussions on cooperative steps on regional
and global problems.
• Mutual recognition that both leaders of the US
and Iran have stated publicly their desire for a
world without nuclear weapons.
• An understanding that the Leader's fatwa
against the building or use of nuclear weapons
could establish an excellent basis for
discussions with the aim of agreement for
greater IAEA access to Iran's nuclear program
to assure the world about Iran's nuclear
intentions and develop an arrangement
regarding enrichment.
• Finally, an understanding of what types of
reciprocal actions might be undertaken by each
side to demonstrate the seriousness of this new
effort to work toward cooperation.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773680 Date: 08/31/2015
B. Getting this message directly to the Supreme Leader is a
major hurdle. We offer several possible approaches:
• First. A senior US Government official,
perhaps the Secretary of State, would make an
oral presentation to the Iran's permanent
representative to the UN, who is the senior
Iranian official within reach and request that
the message get directly to the Supreme Leader.
This approach would have the advantage of not
appearing to bypass President Ahmadinejad
and provide an opportunity for the new Foreign
Minister Salehi to become a player. It would
have the disadvantage of throwing the message
into the middle of Iran's political disorder and
competitive environment where US
relationships have become a touchstone...
• Second. A senior American, not a member of
the administration, could deliver this message
to a senior counterpart in Tehran. For example
Senator Kerry might meet with Larijani the
President of the Majlis. The advantage would
be that it would enable the President to have ,
deniability should this initial approach prove to
be unproductive or be rejected. But the
disadvantage is that it would bring in a key
player who is a strong competitor to
Ahmadinejad and perhaps not be seen as a
serious US Presidential initiative...
• Third. A senior Envoy from the US or a Third
Country could take this message directly to
Ahmadinej ad, who claims to be the strongest
supporter of closer US/Iran contacts. The
advantage of this approach would be to engage
the second most important player in the Iranian
government. The disadvantages are that it
would enhance, at least temporarily,
Ahmadinejad's stature in Iran's governing
structure and open up even more open
opposition within Iran's power elite.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773680 Date: 08/31/2015
• Fourth. A senior statesman from a third
country who has direct access to the Supreme
Leader could be asked to determine whether the
Leader would respond favorably to President
Obama's message. We have in mind someone
like Prime Minister Erdogan of Turkey, who is
one of the few statesmen who probably has
direct access to the Leader. There may well be
others in that category such as Oman. The
advantage of this approach is that Erdogan's
stature as an Islamic leader friendly to Iran
might make the message more credible to the
Leader. Another advantage would be that the
initial approach could be confidential and
provide some deniability for the President
should this approach sour or fail. The
disadvantage would be the involvement of a
third country national whose personal and
national prestige would become engaged and
raise the possibility that the President's
message to the Leader might be distorted or
misunderstood. The Iranians see Turkey in a
competitive and possibly disdainful light based
on a history with periods of confrontation and
tension.
C. Should the initial approach to the Supreme Leader prove
successful in setting up-initial discussions between
designated envoys, one possible and ambitious route for the
administration would be an agreement between President
Obama and the Supreme Leader on a structure to manage
the bilateral differences and promote the common interests.
Such an agreement would provide clear direction to each
government on establishing a new tone and spirit in conducting
relations. It would also set the agenda for cooperation on a
wide range of bilateral problems.
D. The administration would need to develop a public
diplomatic strategy in advance of the first meeting of
empowered representatives to explain the objectives to the

Congress, to our allies and friends and to the American
people.
Conclusion: We can give no assurances that any of these suggestions
would work. We are convinced however that given the Iranian
obsession about US regime change policies and the negative
consequences for US interests of not changing the relationship, the US
will have to take the lead in persuading the Supreme Leader and his
advisers that the US generally seeks a new relationship.

Catty Carla Bruni lifts lid on Michelle Obama's
'hellish' job
By Peter Allen and Michael Seamark
Last updated at 1:26 AM on 16th September 2010
Michelle Obama thinks being America's First Lady is 'hell', Carla Bruni reveals today in a wildly indiscreet new book.
Miss Bruni reveals that Mrs Obama replied when asked about her position as the U.S. president's wife: 'Don't ask! It's
hell. I can't stand it!'
Details of the private conversation, which took place at the White House during an official visit by Nicolas Sarkozy last
March, emer ed in Carla And The Ambitious, a book written in collaboration with Miss Bruni.
No secrets: Michelle Obama, left, and Carla Bruni last year. Bruni made the revelations about the U.S. First Lady's
feelings in a wildly indiscreet new book
In it, she says one term as French president `will be enough' for her husband and suggests he might take tips from his
friend Tony Blair: Why not start making money?'

• France hits back at EU after accusations Sarkozy government acted 'like Nazis' in treatment of Roma
According to a friend quoted in the book, the Sarkozys have been 'impressed and inspired' by Mr Blair's fortune built up
since he left Downing Street.
Miss Bruni also takes a thinly veiled swipe at Princess Diana when talking about a visit to an African hospital full of Aids
victims earlier this year.
She says she refused requests by French cameramen for a photograph of her carrying a baby in her arms 'like Lady Di',
adding: 'There's something obscene in promoting yourself when you are giving of yourself.'
Time limit: Carla with husband Nicolas Sarkozy. She claims one term as French president will be enough for him
Disagreements: Sarkozy with former wife Cecilia in 2006. Carla recounts a telephone row with her in her new book
In the book, the Italian model 42, accuses French government officials of trying to 'kill' her husband with too much work,
and claims Mr Sarkozy lets himself be 'bullied' into complying.
Comparing herself to other leaders' wives, Miss Bruni says: 'I'm so different. I was a model. I sing, and I want to continue
to sing. And on top of that you expect me to be subtle?' And she admits: 'I am a femme fatale, my dear.'
She also recounts a telephone row with Mr Sarkozy's ex-wife Cecilia, who warned her that Mr Sarkozy had 'not yet turned
a new page' after their marriage.
Miss Bruni replied: 'Not only has he turned a page but he's changed books altogether. And you are the only person on
earth not to have noticed it.'

Catty Carla Bruni lifts lid on Michelle Obama's
'hellish' job
By Peter Allen and Michael Seamark
Last updated at 1:26 AM on 16th September 2010
Michelle Obama thinks being America's First Lady is 'hell', Carla Bruni reveals today in a wildly indiscreet new book.
Miss Bruni reveals that Mrs Obama replied when asked about her position as the U.S. president's wife: 'Don't ask! It's
hell. I can't stand it!'
Details of the private conversation, which took place at the White House during an official visit by Nicolas Sarkozy last
March, emer ed in Carla And The Ambitious, a book written in collaboration with Miss Bruni.
No secrets: Michelle Obama, left, and Carla Bruni last year. Bruni made the revelations about the U.S. First Lady's
feelings in a wildly indiscreet new book
In it, she says one term as French president `will be enough' for her husband and suggests he might take tips from his
friend Tony Blair: Why not start making money?'

According to a friend quoted in the book, the Sarkozys have been 'impressed and inspired' by Mr Blair's fortune built up
since he left Downing Street.
Miss Bruni also takes a thinly veiled swipe at Princess Diana when talking about a visit to an African hospital full of Aids
victims earlier this year.
She says she refused requests by French cameramen for a photograph of her carrying a baby in her arms 'like Lady Di',
adding: 'There's something obscene in promoting yourself when you are giving of yourself.'

Disagreements: Sarkozy with former wife Cecilia in 2006. Carla recounts a telephone row with her in her new book
In the book, the Italian model 42, accuses French government officials of trying to 'kill' her husband with too much work,
and claims Mr Sarkozy lets himself be 'bullied' into complying.
Comparing herself to other leaders' wives, Miss Bruni says: 'I'm so different. I was a model. I sing, and I want to continue
to sing. And on top of that you expect me to be subtle?' And she admits: 'I am a femme fatale, my dear.'
She also recounts a telephone row with Mr Sarkozy's ex-wife Cecilia, who warned her that Mr Sarkozy had 'not yet turned
a new page' after their marriage.
Miss Bruni replied: 'Not only has he turned a page but he's changed books altogether. And you are the only person on
earth not to have noticed it.'

Former aide urges Obama to regain 'political narrative'
By Edward Luce in Washington
Published: February 15 2010
Barack Obama, US president, has lost control of the political narrative and needs to make more use of his cabinet in
order to regain it, says John Podesta, the man who headed the president's transition team.
""My friends in the White House would agree with this, that they lost the narrative,"" Mr Podesta said in an interview for
View from DC, the Financial Times' video series from Washington. ""Clearly that needs not one speech once in a while: it
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05774069 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05774069 Date: 08/31/2015
needs, I think, to be constantly reinforced. And not just by the president, but by his entire team ... He's got a terrific
cabinet. Use it. Get out into the country and use it.""
Mr Podesta, who was also a chief of staff to Bill Clinton, drew parallels with the former president's difficulties in his first
two years, which culminated in the 1994 Republican takeover of Congress following the failure of healthcare reform.
When asked whether the failure of this latest attempt at healthcare reform would result in a similar electoral
""massacre"" for the Democratic party at the mid-term elections in November, he said: ""I subscribe to that view.""
Mr Podesta founded the Centre for American Progress, Washington's largest liberal think-tank, which was often
described as a ""government-in-exile"" during the years George W. Bush was in the White House. He said Mr Obama had
three options with healthcare reform. First, try to enact the whole thing by using the budget reconciliation process,
which would enable it to pass with 51 votes. The Democrats lost their controlling 60-seat super-majority last month in a
election defeat in Massachusetts.
The second would be to pass a watered down bill with Republican support. The third would be to abandon the attempt,
as Mr Clinton did in 1993.
Mr Podesta, whom Mr Obama still regularly consults, said there was still a better than 50:50 chance of getting reform
through. ""The worst option among the three is doing nothing, and so they're going to have to figure out which track is
viable,"" he said. ""It may mean doing it with only Democratic votes. But if that is such, then so be it.""
He painted a fairly bleak view of the overall health of US politics. ""It sucks,"" he said. Pointing to a strategy of
obstructionism by Republican lawmakers, he said: ""I think the president is trying to re-engage with Republicans, but,
quite frankly, he's not dealing with the party of [Abraham] Lincoln. He's dealing with the party of [Sarah] Palin.""
The growth of partisanship and the increasing difficulty in getting any big reforms through the Senate were threatening
to turn the US into, ""in essence, a parliamentary system without majority rule"", where the opposition automatically
opposes any serious initiatives.
The political stasis in California provided the writing on the wall for the US as a whole, he said. Since the 1978 passage of
Proposition 13 in the state, all budget changes had required a two-thirds majority. ""And so nothing gets done.""

HALIFAX (AP) —Canada's defense minister says Canada is considering a U.S. request to keep troops in Afghanistan past
2011 and switch from a combat to a training role. Defense Minister Peter MacKay said November 7 the troops would be
""behind the wire"" and not remain in Afghanistan's volatile southern Kandahar province. Parliament has mandated that
the combat mission end in 2011. U.S. Senators John McCain said Lindsey Graham, who both sit on the Armed Services

Robert,
Are you sure that the USA Pavilion would not be in a sponsorship by Wynn Resorts (specifically Wynn Macau)? There
CFO, Matt Maddox, has expressed strong interest.
The Wynn Macau well known brand in China and Steve Wynn is an extremely popular figure in China. In addition, he is
well respected and well though of by the Chinese leadership and business leaders. A sponsorship by Wynn would be
well received.
I should be able to get an answer by early next week, but don't want to look foolish if they would be rejected.

Dear Ms. Mills—
Since the chain of events that led to the Secretary's speaking at the Vietnam conference started with my 15
March 2010 email to you about Brownie Ledbetter's illness, I thought I would close the circle with another
email to you asking if you would pass this letter of appreciation to the Secretary. I wanted to go on record
saying how much we in the Historian's Office, and how very much I personally, appreciated both her presence
and her remarks at the conference.
Best,
John
Dear Secretary Clinton:
Thanks so much for delivering the opening speech at the Historian's Office's Conference on the American
Experience in Southeast Asia. It was eloquent and affecting. Your speech welcoming the audience struck the
perfect note for (1) celebrating the achievement of the Historian's Office documentary histories on
Indochina/Vietnam and (2) using that event to explore the history of United States policy in Southeast Asia,
1946-1975. It also placed in context what we were about to do at the conference. We couldn't have found a
better way to kick off our two days of historical exploration than your speech. You gave us marching orders to
study the conflict in Vietnam and the American role in it but not to let that past blind us to the common ground
our two countries now occupy. And that's what we tried to do.
The conference itself was very successful. We have had good feedback from attendees and from participants.
The speeches of Dr. Kissinger, Deputy Secretary Negroponte, and Ambassador Holbrooke, sent out ripples of
stimulating and provocative discussion, while the scholarly papers presented by American and international
scholars not only placed their comments in historical context but also, and more generally, increased our

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775434 Date: 08/31/2015
knowledge and understanding of conflict in Indochina. The official historians from Vietnam fulfilled one of my
first requirements—that we provide our former enemy's perspective during the conference. And the media
panel—with old Vietnam hands such as William Beecher, Edith Lederer, Marvin Kalb, Morley Safer, and Barry
Zorthian on it—added zip to the proceedings as well as substance to our understanding of the media role in this
conflict. (We put the media panel video on our website Friday, accompanied by a transcript.)
In addition to the preceding I also wanted to tell you how pleased I was to have had the opportunity to briefly
chat with you immediately before your speech, and last March, too, after I gave you the sad news about
Brownie Ledbetter. Throughout that March conversation I was also having an intense debate with myself over
whether I should or should not ask you about opening the conference. I glad I did and glad that you said yes.
I also wish to tell you (no surprise here, I'm sure) how well you are served by the likes of Lona Valmoro and
Lauren Jiloty. Over the spring and summer Lona gave advice and reassurance in a number of emails when I was
structuring what I hoped you would do for and at the conference. She went out of her way to be helpful and
positive. And Lauren, as the conference drew near, gave me the sort of precise guidance, and in an always
friendly and efficient manner, about your speech and the surrounding scenario that lowered my anxiety level
considerably. I am grateful to both of them.
Finally, as I head toward retirement in February, I wanted to tell you that we in the Historian's Office—and none
more than I--see you as a first-rate Secretary of State doing an outstanding job in, to say the least, challenging
circumstances. I am personally proud to have been in the Department and served while you were Secretary.
Again, the speech was great. Thanks for doing it.
Sincerely,
John M. Carland

To more fully answer your question, the CARE speech is important because it focuses on a chronically overlooked issue
(nutrition) that sits at the intersection of two of your signature issues. It gives us an opportunity to sharpen our
development message. It also tees up the health care speech you might give before UNGA. This is a speech that only
you could give and a number of constituencies will be delighted by it.
Hope this helps. I'm going through it now to make sure, it more clearly answers your question.

Ed Miliband's victory was carried by an anti-Blair undercurrent. In the first
round voting, David was ahead. But when the votes of Ed Balls was distributed to
the second choice of voters, they put Ed over. Balls represents Gordon, but even
more a distancing from New Labour. Ed's use of Iraq as an issue is symbolic of
the repudiation of New Labour. Ed had more labor union votes for leader, which
accounted for one-third of total. Ed's ""new generation"" rhetoric covers that
regression and continuing reactive impulse. Now the shadow cabinet, due to a new
decision, will be elected by the party. Ed is the former environment minister
and good on green issues, of course, but has no foreign policy perspective
yet instinctively to the left, which means anti-Afghanistan mission as currently
conceived, it should go without saying. David lost precisely because he held
responsible positions.

Several NSN staff went to a CAP forum with some Chinese bloggers today, and came back emotionally overwhelmed by
the bloggers' positive response to her speech. One of them apparently said the speech was like ""a song to his heart""
and my hard-bitten 20-something staffer said he almost cried when the guy said it. Nice work.

Bill Clinton used to talk about building a bridge to the 21st century. President Obama talks about laying down a ""new
foundation."" But Clinton was always vague about what the land on the other side of that bridge was going to look like,
and Obama is vague about what edifice is going to go on top of that foundation.
They are vague because nobody is clear about what sort of country America is going to be in 2030 or 2050. Nobody has
quite defined America's coming economic identity.
In thinking about this question, it probably helps to start at the beginning. Five hundred years ago, agriculture was the
major economic activity. One hundred years ago, it was industrial production. Now, of course, we're living in an
information age. Innovation and creativity are the engines of economic growth.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05772925 Date: 08/31/2015
Howard Gardner of Harvard once put together a composite picture of the extraordinarily creative person: She comes
from a little place somewhat removed from the center of power and influence. As an adolescent, she feels herself
outgrowing her own small circle. She moves to a metropolis and finds a group of people who share her passions and
interests. She gets involved with a team to create something amazing.
Then, at some point, she finds her own problem, which is related to and yet different from the problems that concern
others in her group. She breaks off and struggles and finally emerges with some new thing. She brings it back to her
circle. It is tested, refined and improved.
The main point in this composite story is that creativity is not a solitary process. It happens within networks. It happens
when talented people get together, when idea systems and mentalities merge.
Now imagine you are this creative person in the year 2010, 2025 or 2050. You are living in some small town in Ukraine or
Kenya or some other place, foreign or domestic. You long to break out and go to a place where people are gathering to
think about the things you are thinking about, creating the things you want to create.
If you are passionate about fashion, maybe you will go to Paris. If it's engineering, maybe it'll be Germany. But if you are
passionate about many other spheres, I suspect you'll want to be in America.
You'll want to be in the U.S. because English has become the global language. You'll want to come because American
universities lead the world in research and draw many of the best minds from all corners of the earth.
You'll want to be there because American institutions are relatively free from corruption. Intellectual property is
protected. Huge venture capital funds already exist.
Moreover, the United States is a universal nation. There are already people there with connections all over the world. A
nation of immigrants is more permeable than say, Chinese society.
You also observe that America hosts the right kind of networks — ones that are flexible and intense. Study after study
suggests that America is one of those societies with high social trust. Americans build large, efficient organizations that
are not bound by the circles of kinship and clan. Study after study finds that Americans are not hierarchical. American
children are raised to challenge their parents. American underlings are relatively free to challenge their bosses. In this
country you're less likely to have to submit to authority.
From this story you can see that economic power in the 21st century is not going to look like economic power in the
20th century. The crucial fact about the new epoch is that creativity needs hubs. Information networks need junction
points. The nation that can make itself the crossroads to the world will have tremendous economic and political power.
In 2009, Anne-Marie Slaughter, now director of policy planning at the State Department, wrote an essay for Foreign
Affairs in which she laid out the logic of this new situation: ""In a networked world, the issue is no longer relative power,
but centrality in an increasingly dense global web.""
Slaughter's essay was titled ""America's Edge."" That is apt. Americans are now in a depressed state of mind. As China and
India rise, nearly two-thirds of Americans believe their nation is in decline.
In fact, the U.S. is well situated to be the crossroads nation. It is well situated to be the center of global networks and to
nurture the right kinds of networks. Building that America means doing everything possible to thicken connections:
finance research to attract scientists; improve infrastructure to ease travel; fix immigration to funnel talent; reform
taxes to attract superstars; make study abroad a rite of passage for college students; take advantage of the millions of
veterans who have served overseas.
The nation with the thickest and most expansive networks will define the age. There's no reason to be pessimistic about
that.

of them and leaving one missing. The officials in Jalisco state said ten officers who survived the attack fought an hours-
long battle with the unknown attackers, and several gunmen were wounded. The attackers, who were riding in about
ten sport utility vehicles, were armed with grenades and assault rifles. They fled into neighboring Michoacan state after
the attack. Michoacan is the home to a violent cartel known to launch fierce attacks on police convoys.

DEAUVILLE (Reuters) - Russia wants to take part in a NATO-backed missile defense shield and will go to next month's
NATO summit, softening its stance after reassurances from France and Germany, a source close to participants said on
October 19.
Security is a major stumbling block in Russia's relationship with the West and has dominated talks between Presidents
Sarkozy and Medvedev and Chancellor Merkel in the northern French seaside town of Deauville.
The source said that Medvedev himself would attend the NATO summit, which is due to unveil a new strategic plan
for the 28-country alliance on November 19-20 in Lisbon.

As you know I have good links to the Qataris. Sheikha Mosah's son is the 31/32 year old Crown Prince and she is keen
that he starts to build a wider international profile. He has been appointed head of the Qatar National Food Security
Programme which is designed to deal with Qatar's food security issues its a $30 billion programme. He is aware that
food security is an issue you are majoring on and would love to meet with you in person to discuss this and to explore
potential partnership areas between US and Qatar including possible participation in the US/World Bank Food Security
Fund. He is also keen to talk more generally about US/Qatari cooperation and even suggested they could help out with
the Oil spill problem. There is apparently a Arab Food Security Summit in October 2010 and he would like to discuss Us
participation in that too.

Cheryl,
I had a good conversation with Bob this afternoon. The major points he wanted to emphasize were the ones he had
included in his emails to you, including:
• ""Rebalancing"" Haitian development: Redevelopment should occur nationwide and encourage a more even
distribution of the Haitian population. The international community should not rebuild Port-au-Prince at the expense of
the rest of the country. Bob thinks that nationwide rebuilding will also reduce the chances of elite capture of the
rebuilding effort, since elites are strongly concentrated in Port-au-Prince.
• Transparency: Bob is cautious about just throwing money at the problem. He thinks the international
community should establish a new norm of transparency in Haiti, for example, to ensure that there isn't widespread
corruption, price gauging, grants of monopolies, etc.
• Link the Haitian business community to other business communities: Bob thinks that if all the rebuilding is done
by the usual suspects in the Haitian business community, they'll simply build back the country they had before. He
recommends working to bring in foreign investors, and then linking foreign investors and leading Haitian businessmen
(e.g., in a business roundtable) to socialize better business practices in Haiti.
• On the issue of legal authorities for reconstruction: Bob recommends exploring whether presidential
commission-like structures could be empowered to resolve the legal problems likely to arise as barriers to
reconstruction.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773532 Date: 08/31/2015
• Duration of US presence: Bob cautioned that most Haitians would be happy to see a long-term US military
presence in the country, though this would likely have adverse reputational consequences in the hemisphere for the
United States. Given that hurricane season will begin in the fall, Bob recommends that when we do draw down, we
make clear that we will return if needed.
• Getting people to work: Bob argued that NGOs may not be the best vehicles for getting Haitians to work (e.g.,
through job training, etc.). In short, they're too nice. Many Haitians have never held a regular job, are unfamiliar with
showing up on time, etc. They'll need a bit of tough love and discipline. Bob though ex-military might set the right kind
of example.
• Diaspora: Engaging the diaspora is clearly important, but we do not want to support widespread repatriation of
the diaspora as NGO employees, reconstruction experts, etc., at the expense of Haitians who never left. This reinforces
wage differentials and social discontent about returnees.
• Conditional cash transfers: Bob thinks that conditional cash transfer programs have a lot of potential to improve
education and the delivery of health services in Haiti.

DOHA (AP) - A Sudanese official said his government has withdrawn from peace talks with Darfur rebel
groups, but it is still committed to making peace. Sudan's President Omar al-Bashir threatened to call off the
talks in Qatar and return negotiations to Sudan if agreement was not reached by December 30, and he carried
out his threat. Chief government negotiator Ghazi Salaheddine said the Sudanese delegation will leave for
Khartoum December 31. Ahmed Hussain Adam, a rebel spokesman, described the move as ""a declaration of
war"" in remarks to Al-Jazeera TV.

Northern Ireland agrees power-sharing deal
Gordon Brown hails historic deal which will see justice and policing powers be devolved to Stormont from 12 April

Justice and policing powers will be devolved to Northern Ireland <http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/northernireland>'s
power-sharing government from 12 April in a historic deal agreed by the main parties that ""opens a new chapter"" after
decades of violence, Gordon Brown said today.
Standing alongside his Irish counterpart, Brian Cowen, at a press conference at Hillsborough Castle outside Belfast, the
prime minister said the ""inspirational"" agreement between Sinn Fein <http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/sinn-fein>
and the Democratic Unionist party (DUP) <http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/dup> was a foundation for lasting peace.
The deal — finally agreed to by the DUP <http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2010/feb/05/northern-ireland-dup-ulster-
deal> last night and described as a final piece in the jigsaw after a long search for peace — comes after two weeks of
round-the-clock negotiations and brings an end to fears that the power-sharing government might collapse.
It will see policing and justice powers devolved from Westminster to the assembly within weeks and includes new plans
on overseeing parades.
Brown, who travelled to Belfast this morning, said the agreement had been possible because of ""a new spirit of mutual
co-operation and respect"".
The deal meets a key Sinn Fein demand and prevents the republican party from walking out of the power-sharing
executive. In return, the DUP has secured reforms to the way loyalist marches are handled in Northern Ireland, including
the abolition of the Parades Commission, a body most unionists regard as biased in favour of nationalists.
A cross-community vote will now be held in the Stormont assembly on 9 March before the policing and justice powers
are devolved from London on 12 April.
Brown told reporters: ""The achievements have been as great as they are inspirational. This moment and this agreement
belongs to the people of Northern Ireland, all of the people, and now more than ever before so does their future ... This
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773269 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773269 Date: 08/31/2015
is the last chapter of a long and troubled story and the beginning of a new chapter after decades of violence, years of
talks, weeks of stalemate.""
Cowen praised both unionists and nationalists for making ""fair and balanced compromises"" to bridge the divisions and
said the quality of the negotiations meant that the ""devolved institutions can and will work"".
The Northern Ireland secretary, Shaun Woodward, said the deal would further isolate republican dissidents who have
launched three separate gun and bomb attacks against police stations in the province over the last 10 days. The deal
would ""absolutely"" make Northern Ireland a safer place, he said.
The DUP leader, Peter Robinson, said the agreement ""will be more enduring because of the time spent"" in forming it.
Referring back to the Belfast Agreement of 1998 <http://www.nio.gov.uk/the-agreement> when negotiations bore fruit
at the 11th hour, the Sinn Fein president, Gerry Adams, described the current deal and the rescue of power-sharing as
""yet another very good Friday"".
Jeffrey Donaldson told the Guardian the DUP's 36-strong assembly team was now unanimously in favour of the deal.
But the Ulster Unionist party (UUP) has yet to officially back the package which will allow the assembly to set up
legislation to change the way parades are judged.
A UUP spokeswoman said members wanted to see the proposed agreement before giving their response to the two
governments. ""We have not had sight of this agreement and until we do we will not be signing up to it,"" she said.
The talks, which centred on Hillsborough Castle, outside Belfast, are the longest set of continuous negotiations held in
the near 20-year peace process. Sinn Fein had accused the DUP of stalling on the transfer of policing powers for the last
three years and it was feared that failure to find agreement could see the collapse of the power-sharing government led
by the two parties.
The agreement finally came near midnight at Stormont's parliament building. Earlier in the evening Sinn Fein had said
the basis of a deal was on the table and it was giving the DUP leadership the time to persuade its party to accept it.
Robinson emerged from a meeting of party colleagues to confirm that he had secured unanimous support for the
proposals. Earlier in the week up to 14 DUP assembly members had opposed a proposed deal because it did not give
unionists enough concessions.
Robinson said he would now look to gain the support of the community and the smaller assembly parties for the deal.
""We have a basis upon which we can go forward and recommend it [the deal] to our party, to the other parties in
Northern Ireland and to the community.
""An essential element of the Democratic Unionist Party's manifesto is the requirement for community confidence; we
believe this can be the basis for gaining that confidence.""
However the leader of the hardline Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV), Jim Allister, questioned why the 14 DUP rebels had
changed their minds.
""The deal hasn't changed, only the snowmen of the DUP, who melted once the heat came on,"" Allister said.
The DUP now faces a struggle to ward off the TUV threat in the forthcoming general election. Allister will portray the
deal as a sell-out of unionist principles and a sop to republicanism.

One other thought.
If the idea of building network of small new schools is just nuts given the infrastructure challenges, an alternative is
more of the 'street school' approach. We take storefronts, little mom and pop storefronts, etc...and do minor
reconfiguration and you have a whole set of little street schools clustered around central location. This could work,
poses some challenges re: isolation of teachers, ability to offer a robust set of classes/offerings, but can still do the job,
and can still have clear grand openings to help jumpstart culture, etc.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05772910 Date: 08/31/2015
Hey Cheryl,
Here are some quick thoughts on re-building school infrastructure in Port-au-Prince. Feel free to share with whomever
you'd like.
I have little idea of the larger context here — how many schools/kids are we looking at, but one thing we've learned in
the US in the last 5 years is that good teachers are the #1 lever of change in education. If we got 1,000 really great
teachers into Port-au-Prince (w/ even a modicum of support and materials), they'd make a big difference and touch the
lives of 30,000-60,000 kids.
I think this is totally doable, in short-order, in a magnificent way that could set the foundation for a well-educated
generation of Haitians who could lead the country out of poverty, to self-sustainability, self-governance and openness.
To do--
Goal 1: Bring immediate influx of human capital into education sector in concentrated areas, and map out plan for long-
term development of teachers/human capital.
Goal 2: Build curriculum, instructional materials that will support current Haitian elementary age students learning the
academic and related skills they need to lead country to long-term sustainability.
Goal 3: Build/reconstruct schools and training centers that will support high quality education, and on their own,
motivate and inspire children, families, and communities to send children to school.
Goal 4: Create (develop) family, community, economic, cultural, socio-political infrastructure that encourages and
support all children going to school through elementary school, with goal of eradicating illiteracy and expanding the
average level of education for Port-a-Prince residents to the [6th/8thj grade.
Goal 1: Human Capital:
Create Haiti Teacher Corps. Model loosely off of Peace Corps/Teach for America, CityYear
Teacher corps (US): Recruit, train, and place 500-1000 teachers from US this spring and summer. We can do this.
o Recruiting: Limit variable this year, and build up and out as we go. This spring we go to Georgetown, Univ of
Maryland and Univ of Miami and University of Florida/S. Florida. Given crisis, current opportunities in the US, we could
easily hire 500 college graduates of very high quality from 4 major universities under 2 year contracts.
o Summer institute is 8 weeks in US; language training, intensive teacher training; onsite at two major universities
(College Park, Univ. of Miami).
o Language/culture training: TDB — find the best folks out there to train in French/Creole, and Haitian culture,
current socio-political situation — 50% of the training program.
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05772910 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05772910 Date: 08/31/2015
o Academic training: We'll work w/ TFA and others and develop 8 week intensive teacher training program for other
50% of program.
-
Teacher Corps (Haitian):
o I need to learn more on this...but this would likely be critical both short-and long-term.
o Need to know who/how to recruit. Avoid political pitfalls; focus on what we've learned about good teachers—you
want people who have excelled in something—almost anything; so, we set up recruiting team on the ground in Haiti to
find cohort of 500 new teachers; training is nearly identical to US teaching corp (i.e., modeled off of TFA summer
institute).
o Training: either bring them over to US to live and learn w/ US counterparts, or if that's too precarious, look to
move them out of the city for 6-8 weeks over the summer. Find space 100 miles out and build summer camp/institute
for them.
- Teacher leaders/principals/trainers:
o Much easier than you'd think. Huge network now in the charter and ed reform community of hard-working,
mission-driven teacher-leaders who would take this on.
o (US Based) TFA/New Teacher Project alumni are in schools all over the US. They have taught for 2-6 years, want a
chance to do something totally meaningful. This is is. We'll recruit 100-200 of them, and they will lead cohorts of 20
teachers...
o Haiti-based: Less clear what the teacher-leader pipeline is like...but we can figure out and get whoever we can.
Compensation, related.
o We should build dorms/apts for people. Serve food in cafeteria's on-site at the schools; have community kitchens
available, etc.
o All US staff gets paid minimally during their tour/commitment, but earns stipends/completion bonuses. If folks
convinced their expenses will be covered, they will have money to spend, we then backload this. So, might be a $10,000
salary and a $10,000 bonus upon completion. You live cheap; two years later, you get check that amounts to what you
would have saved if you had been living, working, paying bills, etc. in the US.
o Not sure about how to do Haitian pay. But structure similarly.
What do we need to accomplish the Human Capital Goal?
o In the US, not much.
A small staff of the right people could recruit, interview, assess and hire 500 corp members and we could get that
done between Feb 1 and June 1, 2010—easily.
Cost:
2-4 staff on board by 2.1; 10-15 staff on board by 3.1.10; that team will get everyone hired by 6.1.10
Summer training institutes: 500-100 teachers, housing at universities; training/supervision staff at 1:20 ratio to
recruits

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05772910 Date: 08/31/2015
• 8.1.10—Teaching Corp heads to Haiti, ongoing cost of housing, stipends/salary, health care, training/supervision,
etc (we could build out draft operating budget quickly, but not doing that now).
o In Haiti, less clear, but I think if we identify the right people, we'd concurrently recruit, interview, assess, hire 500
people.
Staffing and Cost: See notes above re: US recruitment and training. Assess current status in Haiti, and set up
staffing, recruiting, hr function.
Concurrently, we have team that is developing summer training materials, and working on curriculum/content
(see below).
Concurrently, we have team that is working on facilities (see below)
Concurrently, we have team working on community outreach (see below).
Goal 2: Build a robust curriculum and teacher instruction program
We need to immediately tilt teaching and learning in the early grades to the skills and contents that are necessary in
Haiti so that it people can enable it grow and develop economically, politically.
I am not a curriculum expert, but I think this is really doable, as well, so long as we get the right team—which in this case
is likely a team of leading experts from Haiti, possibly other countries that have intentionally undergone an intensive
ramp-up in the education sector, and US curriculum writers.
- US-Team:
o Similar to above, there is incredible talent in the charters, and in a few major cities where structural education
reform has taken hold.
o We just need a small team to join us for 1 year to help us jump start the project.
-
Haiti/Other countries:
o We need to talk w/ folks in Haiti and find current state of curriculum, standards, instructional guides, books,
materials, etc.
Backwards Mapping: This is not as hard as it seems.
o We get the right people to help us figure out what a 10-12 year old Haitian should know and we map backwards,
all the way to preschool.
o Once we get an end goal in key areas – math, reading, writing, history/social studies, science...we map backwards
and start to define what we will teach.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05772910 Date: 08/31/2015
o And once we decide this, we use some of the tools we've developed in the US in the last 5-10 years to help us
write curriculum, produce instructional materials.
o This will be a jumbled mess to start...but will work and sort itself out.
o We build it in clusters and in modules that can be swapped in and out, and mixed and matched. You want to give
teachers tools so they can be successful with kids of different ages and abilities, particularly early on when we're likely
to be operating more like one-room school houses than grade level schools we're used to here.
o We build in assessments, standards, and teach teachers how to recognize when kids are falling behind, how to
build in supports and tutorials.
o The goal is to get large cohort of younger kids, I think, who start to learn and be taught to standards...all the while,
we push hard in the upper grades, knowing it will be a lot less clear (and possibly much more directed towards helping
current teens develop basic skills they need to be employable and contributing members of the rebuilding efforts –so
this may be basic literacy, key vocational skills, etc.).
Cost/staffing: Small US team that works with Haitian/other country team. Within a year or so, this team should be
Haiti-based, w/ possible long-term support/membership from the US team. The start-up team sets up framework,
establishing learning standards, builds tools and cranks out curricular materials—some of which are developed
specifically for Haiti, but many of which may be translations from high quality materials from US and elsewhere.
Goal 3: Build high quality, durable schools that entice families, children into education.
In spite of current situation, this seems like another very doable goal.
Get some schools built quickly to entice attendance.
o Once rebuilding starts up, we can build schools quickly, affordably. And once they are up, if done correctly, they
will immediately be attractive to families and communities. This, ironically, will be the case if we can get schools up
quickly—while much of the other infrastructure is still in poor shape. Families will want kids in schools if the schools are
safe, offer food, health care and structure—much of which will be wanting in devastated, poor neighborhoods.
I'm not facilities expert, either; this is an area where we can look to other examples in the developing world for
best practices. Nonprofits and governments have worked together to build great schools in many places in Africa, South
America, and even recently in the Middle East.
To think about: Consider technology and technology infrastructure as a part of the initial construction plan so it's
not add-on later.
To think about: Keeping the schools small, functional, really basic will help us get them up; including significant
health care and related services complicates planning, build-out, but increases functionality.
Cost/staffing: I don't have enough knowledge about this, particularly in Haiti. I think it would be quite easy to find
the best models and quickly develop turnkey model for design/build that would ensure functionality, safety, and cost
compliance.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05772910 Date: 08/31/2015
Once we have this, we either develop this capacity internally, or contract out and get these built, quickly.
Goal 4: Create family, community impetus for all school age children to be in school
This is both the end-game and a necessary condition along the way.
The simpleton in me thinks that highly engaged, spirited teachers, inside safe, modern school buildings that serve
healthy meals at no charge will, for some period of time (years) be a catalyst for socio-political change. And if we can
get traction for a few years, and get large cohorts of young children actively engaged in school, then it will be hard to
unwind the long-term, salutary benefits.
Clearly, if families remain in poverty, and adults have no means to earn enough money to support families, then
children of all ages, but particularly as they move toward teen years, will be attracted to alternatives other than school—
some legitimate, but low-wage, and others illegal and destructive.
In short-term, while we are developing program, we should be doing extensive community outreach and in all
cases, getting neighborhoods and communities engaged in the pre-planning process. Families everywhere get excited
about a new school, new teachers, and a new chance. And w should play on this—this will enable us to do necessary
planning around enrollment, student/family needs, etc. We shouldn't sort of move slowly from no school to some
school, we should go from no school to a new school and fresh start—even if that delays opening a bit. The first day
should be major community event, that everyone can reflect upon and hold to in difficult times.
Gotta run. See you shortly.

So cool... and I agree, Minnie... while I was watching Titanic last night (you can't hear Celine Dion enough, you know)
several emailed me to say they were watching the Bosslady on 60 Minutes and how they were so glad and thankful she

From Foster Care To Law School Graduate, Howard University Student Beats The Odds
Jelani Freeman lived in 6 foster homes in 10 years
Updated: Friday, 07 May 2010, 8:25 PM EDT Published : Friday, 07 May 2010, 7:55 PM EDT
By BETH PARKER/myfoxdc
WASHINGTON - Jelani Freeman has gone through a lot to wear this robe. This weekend, he will graduate from Howard
University Law School.
He remembers the shaky foundation of his young life. A mother who could not take care of him. He lived in six foster
homes in ten years.
""Moving to these different homes. The kids were like 'you weren't here yesterday.' Where's your mom at?"" said
Freeman.
At 18 years old, he left the system and went to college in search of room and board. He knew what people expected of
kids in the foster care system - not much.
""All I would hear is that they were in jail or homeless or weren't doing too well,"" said Freeman.
He beat the odds and graduated, but he felt ... alone.
""I can distinctly remember walking across the stage in undergrad. You know at graduation everyone has their cheer
section that yells as you walk across the stage and there was almost silence as I walked across,"" said Freeman.
It will be different this time. When Freeman gets his diploma Saturday at the convention center, there will be 26 people
- friends and supporters from as far away as California - in D.C. to show their support.
Freeman also got a boost from an internship program for kids who have spent time in foster care. He was placed in the
office of then Senator Hillary Clinton. Clinton even mentions him in the updated version of her book ""It Takes A Village.""
Now, he may use his law degree to work on public policy - especially children's issues. He wants all kids to know:
""There's a bright future out there for you if you stay focused and work hard.""

CAIRO (Reuters) - Egypt's opposition Muslim Brotherhood, which held a fifth of seats in the outgoing parliament, has
pulled out of an election race after winning no seats in the first round, al-Arabiya television reported.
The group, which runs candidates as independents to skirt a ban on religious parties, said the vote was rigged in favor
of President Mubarak's ruling party.
Al-Arabiya said the group was pulling out of a run-off to be held on December 5. The group said 26 of its candidates
had made it through to the run-off. A senior Brotherhood official told Reuters an announcement would be made later
on December 1.

******************
The allegation against Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus of 'diverting foreign aid from Grameen Bank to another
company' should be investigated, the prime minister has said.
""Bangladesh has set many examples. Deceiving people by siphoning off their money is another such example. This is
nothing but sucking out money from the people after giving them loans,"" she said replying to questions from journalists
on Sunday.
""There has been no improvement in the lifestyle of the poor so far. They were just used as pawns to get more aids,""
Hasina added.
She was speaking at a press conference at her office on Sunday following her three-nation tour of Russia, Belgium and
Japan.
""The people of Bangladesh have been made guinea pigs. I have never supported that. And now I protest,"" Hasina told
journalists.
Naimul Islam Khan, editor of Amader Shomoy, said, ""Initially, the government had 60 percent share of the Grameen
Bank which now has shrunk to 25 percent. It seems Mr Yunus wanted to empty the government exchequer, if he could.
The government, however, didn't let that happen.""
He also asked whether the government would investigate the allegation raised against Yunus and his Grameen Bank.
Responding to the query, the prime minister said, ""Grameen Bank had been grabbed in such a manner as if it's a
personal property. This should also be investigated. The poor people are becoming paupers. They have been tricked by
sweet talks. Finally, things are getting out.""
Hasina compared Khaleda Zia's 'affection' for her cantonment house with Yunus' affection' for his Grameen Bank and
said, ""Grameen Bank is a public property. But it's being privatised out of 'love'. Yunus Sahib has fallen in love with
Grameen Bank.
""One can't but get caught if play with the money of the poor,"" she added.

Norway's national TV NRK aired a documentary on November 30 titled ""Fanget i Mikrogjeld"" or ""Caught in Micro debt"",
based on which bdnews24.com ran a report on December 1.
According to the documentary, Yunus transferred the money to Grameen Kalyan, which was in no way involved with
microcredit operations.
Responding to the allegations, Grameen Bank claimed there was no wrongdoing in the agreement between the bank
and Grameen Kalyan under which it received Tk 3,917 million from the bank.
""Decisions were taken by the Grameen Bank Board, with due deliberation, good faith, and with good intentions to
benefit the poor,"" the Grameen Bank rejoinder said.

Statement by the Secretary
The Death of Polish President Kaczynski and His Delegation
I join President Obama in offering my deepest condolences to the people of Poland, to the Kaczynski family, and to the
families of all those killed in this tragedy. Lost alongside President Kaczynski and his wife were Polish leaders from
across the political spectrum, men and women who shaped and sped Poland's post-1989 democratic transformation and
were leading Poland into its promising future. The tragedy of these lives cut short will be felt deeply across the world,
but their legacy will live on in a free and flourishing Poland.
The United States stands with the Polish people in this difficult hour. Like the country he led, President Kaczynski was
one of America's most valued and trusted allies. He was well known in the United States as a champion for democracy
against an oppressive regime, a man whose journey took him from the Gdarisk Shipyards to the presidency of a free
people. President Kaczynski was an unstinting advocate for freedom and human rights not just in Poland, but around
the world. He will be long remembered and sorely missed.
The Polish people have endured more than their share of sorrow, but they have always shown resilience and resolve in
the face of adversity -- and I know they will pull together in solidarity to grieve this loss.
My thoughts and prayers are with all the people of Poland today.

Dear Hillary and Anne-Marie,
For several months I've been advising on a project to take the rainforest restoration work of Dr. Willie Smits, an
Indonesian agroforester, to scale on Borneo. That Smits Model effort now has an economically sustainable design with
multiple benefits for the local forest population, the nation of Indonesia, and the planet. The business plan has been
developed by an experienced and highly reputable investment group that serves in an Advisory role to the Prince of
Wales's Trust, and the business plan has already engaged the interest of the P8, a group of the eight largest global
pension funds.
The core goals of the Arenga Reforestation Project include greenhouse gas reduction, habitat restoration, rainforest
remediation, deforestation protection, biofuel production that is non-food and carbon-positive, and poverty alleviation
for some of the most vulnerable populations on the planet. The Internal Rate of Return, on a fairly mature business
model and seven years of module testing, calculates to about 34% -- a decent investment return for almost any industry.
You can watch Willie Smits describe the possibilities at TED (to a standing ovation) here:

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05776222 Date: 08/31/2015
The State Department has been on the periphery of the concept development through Moira O'Neill, a Haas Professor
of Business on loan to USAID from Cal. She has kept the conversation going with the White House, USAID, and State, but
is extremely busy with a range of other obligations and may not have the cycles to follow this to a conclusion.
In my view this effort, the Arenga Reforestation Project, is the leading contender for an economically sustainable
tropical reforestation program, and has an unprecedented climate mitigation potential (Indo'nesia is the world's #4
greenhouse-gas emitter, due largely to the burning and composting of the southern Kalimantan peat swamps and to
rapid destruction of rainforest, both of which the Smits Model can reverse). In Aug 08 I spent 11 days visiting key sites of
this project in Borneo, largely with Dr. Smits, whom I've known for about 20 years. In my opinion, and that of many
others, this is the world's most sophisticated and powerful model for integrated ecological and economic restoration,
with exciting prospects for much of the tropics. I can also vouch for the quality and integrity of the key people involved.
To make the impact even more noteworthy, the Minister of Forestry in Indonesia has now agreed to a 1:1 acreage
match between Smits Model reforestation and the protection of virgin rainforest in perpetuity as national park. For
every 30,000 hectares of Smits Model reforestation, the Ministry will designate 30,000 hectares (about 116 square
miles) of virgin rainforest a National Park, and they have agreed to external monitoring by international NGOs for
compliance. Since this Smits Model can scale to a million hectares, or ten million, with continually increasing economic,
social, and environmental benefits, the two-fer impact is perhaps unprecedented.
It would be worthwhile for you to have someone from your staff take a look at this. In my carefully considered view, the
political, social, and REDD benefits could be very substantial, and the possibility of a Public-Private Partnership is worth
consideration.
The primary source for information on the project in the US is my friend and Senior Fellow at RMI, the remarkable Eric
Rasmussen, MD, MDM, FACP CEO of the Google-founded humanitarian NGO called InSTEDD. He's leading, pro bono,
the team developing the business plan, and can be reached at or on cell at
Pacific Time Zone.

Cheryl,
Local media drew attention this weekend to the line in the introduction of our annual human rights report that
refers to the GOH by saying that there is severe corruption in all branches of government. called this
morning asking for a copy of the report (which we sent him), saying that the President was upset and wanted to read it.
The Embassy human rights officer sent the Department a first draft of this report late last year. It normally would have
gone through two or three more versions with input from DRL and ultimately clearance by the Embassy Front Office.

Because our Human Rights officer (Kathey-Lee Galvin) was seriously injured in the quake, DRL took it upon themselves to
finish the report. The final draft was never sent to us for clearance/comments and I don't know who all in the
Department cleared off on it. You may already be familiar with the report, but in the event you are not, I wanted you to
have a copy in advance of meetings in Santo Domingo where you may hear about it from Cheers,

Subject: Brief memo for Cheryl Mills on Colombia - for Secretary Clinton
Dear Cheryl —
In my last email (Friday, 5/28), I attached the letter from the bipartisan Co-Chairs and Executive Committee members of
the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission sent to Assistant Secretary Mike Posner expressing grave concern about the
recent rise in death threats, attacks and murders of Colombian human rights defenders, religious, community and other
NGO leaders. Congressman McGovern also strongly encouraged the Secretary to meet with representatives of those
organizations and individuals being threatened, with a particularly effort to reach out to and invite the Bishops of
Tumaco (Narifio), Barrancabermeja/Medio Magdalena (Santander), and we would now add Putumayo, since the
Colombian Catholic Church just advised us yesterday of increased death threats against religious workers there. In
addition, we recommended inviting Monserior Hector Fabio Henao, director of Pastoral Social, at the Archdiocese in
Bogota, who represents all the pastoral work of the Church throughout the country, as well as representatives from the
Mennonite and Lutheran churches, in particular.
While in Colombia, the most important thing the Secretary can do is avoid effusive praise for President Alvaro Uribe,
who leaves office in August. Inside Colombia, the visit by the Secretary is being described as focusing solely on the free
trade agreement and continuing support of the counterdrug strategy/Plan Colombia. Without changes in the human
rights situation and the culture of impunity, it is unlikely that anything the Secretary might say or do will alter the
equation on Capitol Hill regarding the trade agreement. It should be noted that the October 2008 GAO report on the
counter-drug operations in Colombia concluded that U.S. assistance was successful in increasing security in parts of the
country, but a failure in the areas of counter-narcotics (GAO-09-71) , and a subsequent April 2009 USAID evaluation on
U.S. aid for Plan Colombia for illegal crop reduction and Colombian counternarcotics policies actually contribute to
increased coca production.
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775576 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775576 Date: 08/31/2015
The Colombian president has been a solid backer of U.S. policy and U.S. interests in the region, and has achieved some
important improvements in the country's security situation. It is important to recognize that, but to do so without
repeating the tone of Defense Secretary Gates' April visit, in which he called Uribe a ""great hero""
<http://www.defense.gov/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=58754> and failed even to mention any concerns.
These concerns are of critical importance, and while the Secretary need not list them all, at least some deserve public
acknowledgement — some recognition that it is important to the United States that Colombia, including the current
government and its successor, show the necessary political will to deal with them:
A sharp rise in alleged military killings of civilians. In many cases, these are so-called ""false positives"": non-
combatants murdered and later presented as members of armed groups killed in combat. These, notes
<http://www.extrajudicialexecutions.org/colombia> UN Special Rapporter for Extrajudicial Executions Philip Alston,
""began occurring with a disturbing frequency across Colombia from 2004."" Citing prosecutors' and NGOs' reports, Alston
indicates that Colombia's security forces may have killed 1,486 civilians during the first six years of Alvaro Uribe's
presidency. Alston notes that the Defense Ministry only began to address the situation after the media broke the story
of the false-positives and the subsequent negative publicity and horrified public outcry.
The prosecution of ""false positives"" is moving with excruciating slowness. In perhaps the most notorious case — the
murders of about twenty young men from the poor Bogota suburb of Soacha — nearly all of the accused soldiers and
officers have been released from prison <http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=49968>, pending trial, as
deadlines for timely prosecution have run out. Since their arrest in late 2008, their case has been prolonged by
numerous delaying tactics by the defense, including attempts to have their cases tried in the military court system as
""acts of service."" Alston reports that the impunity rate on these extrajudicial murders by security forces may be as high
as 98.5 percent.
Mounting allegations that the President's intelligence service, the DAS, was put at the service
<http://www.cipcol.org/?p=1123> of paramilitary leaders and narcotraffickers; used to spy on and intimidate
<http://www.cipcol.org/?p=752> Supreme Court justices, opposition politicians, journalists and human rights
defenders; and employed in a campaign of sabotage and smears <http://www.cipcol.or.g/?p=1467> against political
opponents.
Prosecutors are alleging that the orders to have the DAS carry out wiretaps, surveillance and ""political warfare"" came
from high up in the Colombian presidency <http://www.caracoltv.com/noticias/justicia/articulo168592-tres-asesores-
de-uribe-son-investigados-chuzadas-ilegales> , though the question of ""what President Uribe knew, and when he knew
it"" remains unanswered. Meanwhile efforts to reform or dissolve the DAS are stalled in Colombia's Congress.
President Uribe's political coalition has also been hit by a scandal known in Colombia as ""para-politics."" This
•
coalition has included dozens of political bosses from regions beyond the capital. Many are large landholders with ties to
narcotrafficking, the same local leaders who created and fostered the brutal pro-government paramilitary groups that
killed tens of thousands of non-combatants in the 1990s and early 2000s.
Evidence, much of it from former paramilitary leaders, has brought about 300 criminal investigations against legislators,
governors, mayors and other local officials, nearly all of them Alvaro Uribe's political supporters, who made common
cause with the far-right warlords. To date, of the 278 congresspeople and senators elected in 2006, 68
<http://www.nuevoarcoiris.org.co/sac/?q=node/64> are under official investigation, on trial, or convicted for
paramilitary ties. Those embroiled in parapolitics include the President's cousin, Mario Uribe; the brother of his former
foreign minister; and individuals whom the President had named to be Colombia's ambassadors to Chile, the Dominican
Republic, and Canada.
The Colombian prosecutors, investigators, witnesses and non-governmental organizations trying to uncover the truth
about these abuses are working under conditions of great personal risk. They, too, are heroes and would benefit greatly

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775576 Date: 08/31/2015
from a public expression of concern about the cases they are investigating, and a reminder that their work is legitimate
and important to U.S. interests in Colombia.
At the same time, it is important to avoid appearing to endorse any candidate in the June 20 runoff elections. Between
the first and second rounds of a country's presidential election is a politically awkward time for a high-level official visit.
Though President Uribe's former defense minister, Juan Manuel Santos, is the overwhelming favorite given his margin of
success in the May 30th first round of balloting over former Bogota mayor Antanas Mockus, it is necessary at this stage
to convey a sense of balance and a willingness to work closely with whoever wins. As a result, any kind words for one
candidate should be balanced by praise for the other.
Finally, it would be helpful to remind the Colombian people that the United States supports a peaceful resolution of
Bogota's worsening differences with Venezuela. While President Chavez's behavior is a significant concern, it would be
most unhelpful to be perceived on this trip as fanning the flames of conflict with Colombia — or playing into the Chavez
rhetoric that the U.S. and Colombia have military aspirations in the region.
Hope this memo, along with last week's copy of the TLHRC letter to Assistant Secretary Posner, are helpful and useful
materials for the Secretary as she plans her trip.
Very best wishes —
On behalf of Cong. Jim McGovern

Subject: Asia trip
I just wanted to give you some background on the initiatives that New Zealand and Australia have put together to
empower women in the Pacific region and which they would like to spotlight during the Secretary's trip.
NZ wants to announce a collaboration between us and their government to increase women's political participation in
the Pacific region. Their development agency has made this a priority for the Secretary's trip. Our hope is that S will
welcome the collaboration in her remarks at a business leaders, et al reception.
Australia wants to announce a collaboration with us on an initiative to combat violence against women in the region. I
don't know where this will be included in S's remarks, but I hope it will. Both governments are committing significant
resources; we are committing much less, but Australia and NZ are eager to partner with us to address challenges in the
Pacific region.
I wanted to briefly share some thoughts on this formed during my last trip to China. It made the collaboration with NZ
and Australia on deeper engagement with the Pacific Islands on women and development issues that much more
compelling.
I was in Shanghai and Beijing last month to speak at the All-China Women's Federation (ACWF) international women's
forum to commemorate the 15th anniversary of the Beijing women conference and to follow up on our interest to launch
with the Chinese government the US-China Women Leaders Forum.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775470 Date: 08/31/2015
The ACWF is a mass organization affiliated with the Chinese Communist Party with strong leaders, huge resources and
powerful mobilizing forces throughout the country. The Chair, Chen Zhili, is also the Deputy Chair of the National
People's Congress, a former State Councilor; the President, Song Xiuyan, is a former governor of Qinghai Province and
rumored to be appointed as a State Councilor after the change of central leadership in 2012. I met with both of them
when I was there.
As I walked into the welcoming dinner in Shanghai, I found almost everyone I know of significance who works on
women's issues from Southeast Asia, the Pacific and Africa in attendance. However, I did not see government reps from
Europe or NEAsia. It appeared to me that the forum was targeted to engage countries and regions where China is
expanding its influence.
I know S is going to give a policy speech in Australia during this trip. I hope that you will include our commitment to
women in the Pacific Islands, especially through these proposed collaborations with Australia and NZ.
As you know very well, the 12 Pacific Islands, though small in size, represent 12 votes in the UN. They long for our
attention and collaboration. I think women's development issues are one ideal way to further our interests and
engagement.
Have a good trip!

Members of NGO Goal work in the Port-au-Prince streets on September 11, 2010. An United Nations report on the
impoverished Caribbean state, where a magnitude 7.0 earthquake on January 12 killed 250,000 people, said criminal
gangs are increasing their grip on many of the 1,300 camps where most of the estimated 1.3 million homeless are still
based. It painted a desolate picture of Haiti's infrastructure, estimating that almost a quarter of the 230,000 buildings
damaged, including about 150,000 hou
PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti — Nearly nine months after the earthquake, more than a million Haitians still live on
the streets between piles of rubble. One reason: Not a cent of the $1.15 billion the U.S. promised for rebuilding
has arrived.
The money was pledged by Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton in March for use this year in rebuilding.
The U.S. has already spent more than $1.1 billion on post-quake relief, but without long-term funds, the
reconstruction of the wrecked capital cannot begin.
With just a week to go before fiscal 2010 ends, the money is still tied up in Washington. At fault: bureaucracy,
disorganization and a lack of urgency, The Associated Press learned in interviews with officials in the State
Department, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, the White House and the U.N. Office of the Special
Envoy. One senator has held up a key authorization bill because of a $5 million provision he says will be
wasteful.
Meanwhile, deaths in Port-au-Prince are mounting, as quake survivors scramble to live without shelter or food.

""There are truly lives at stake, and the idea that folks are spending more time finger-pointing than getting this
solved is almost unbelievable,"" said John Simon, a former U.S. ambassador to the African Union who is now
with the Center for Global Development, a Washington think tank.
Nor is Haiti getting much from other donors. Some 50 other nations and organizations pledged a total of $8.75
billion for reconstruction, but just $686 million of that has reached Haiti so far — less than 15 percent of the total
promised for 2010-11.
The lack of funds has all but halted reconstruction work by CHF International, the primary U.S.-funded group
assigned to remove rubble and build temporary shelters. Just 2 percent of rubble has been cleared and 13,000
temporary shelters have been built — less than 10 percent of the number planned.
The Maryland-based agency is asking the U.S. government for $16.5 million to remove more than 21 million
cubic feet (600,000 cubic meters) of additional rubble and build 4,000 more temporary houses out of wood and
metal.
""It's just a matter of one phone call and the trucks are out again. We have contractors ready to continue
removing rubble. ... We have local suppliers and international suppliers ready to ship the amount of wood and
construction materials we need,"" said CHF country director Alberto Wilde. ""It's just a matter of money.""

Last week the inaction bore tragic results. On Friday an isolated storm destroyed an estimated 8,000 tarps, tents
and shacks in the capital and killed at least six people, including two children. And the threat of violence looms
as landowners threaten entire camps with forced eviction.
In Washington there is confusion about the money. At a July hearing, Ravij Shah, director of the U.S. Agency
for International Development, thanked members of Congress for approving the funds, saying, ""The resources
are flowing and are being spent in country.""
It wasn't true then, and still hasn't happened.
When the earthquake hit, U.S. agencies sent troops, rescuers, aid workers and supplies to the devastated capital,
Port-au-Prince. On March 24, President Barack Obama asked Congress for $2.8 billion in emergency aid to
Haiti — about half to pay back money already spent by USAID, the Defense Department and others. An
additional $212 million was to write off debt.
The heart of the request was $1.15 billion in new reconstruction funds.
A week later, Clinton touted that figure in front of representatives of 50 nations at the U.N. secretariat, the
president of Haiti at her side.
""If the effort to rebuild is slow or insufficient, if it is marked by conflict, lack of coordination or lack of
transparency, then the challenges that have plagued Haiti for years could erupt with regional and global
consequences,"" Clinton said.
That was nearly six months ago. It took until May for the Senate to pass a supplemental request for the Haiti
funds and until July for the House to do the same. The votes made $917 million available but did not dictate
how or when to spend it. Without that final step, the money remains in the U.S. Treasury.
Then came summer recess, emergencies in Pakistan and elsewhere, and the distractions of election politics.

Now the authorization bill that would direct how the aid is delivered remains sidelined by a senator who
anonymously pulled it for further study. Through calls to dozens of senators' offices, the AP learned it was Sen.
Tom Coburn, a Republican from Oklahoma.
""He is holding the bill because it includes an unnecessary senior Haiti coordinator when we already have one""
in U.S. Ambassador Kenneth Merten, Coburn spokeswoman Becky Bernhardt said.
The bill proposes a new coordinator in Washington who would not oversee U.S. aid but would work with the
USAID administrator in Washington to develop a rebuilding strategy. The position would cost $1 million a year
for five years, including salaries and expenses for a staff of up to seven people.
With the bill on hold, the State Department is trying to move the money along by avoiding Congress as much as
possible. It sent lawmakers a ""spending plan"" on Sept. 20 and gave legislators 15 days to review it. If they fail
to act on the plan, the money could be released as soon as specific projects get the OK.
""We need to make sure that the needs of the Haitian people are not sacrificed to procedural and bureaucratic
impediments,"" Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman John Kerry told the AP by e-mail. ""As we
approach nine months since the earthquake, further delays on any side are unacceptable.""
Asked when the money will actually come, State Department spokesman Charles Luoma-Overstreet said the
department expects to start spending in the coming weeks and months. He added that $275 million in ""bridge""
funds were released in March and have gone toward agriculture, work, health and shelter programs — not long-
term reconstruction.
Haitian advocates say that is not enough.
Jean-Claude Bajeux of the Ecumenical Center for Human Rights in Port-au-Prince said this phase was supposed
to be about building semi-permanent houses.
""Where are they? We haven't seen them,"" he said. ""There is not much money that is being used. There is not
much work that has actually been done.""
Of course there is no guarantee that the money would lead to the successful rebuilding of Haiti. Many past U.S.
aid efforts have fallen short.
""I don't think (the money) will make any difference,"" said Haitian human rights advocate Pierre Esperance.
""Haitian people are not really involved in this process.""
But officials agree the funds could pay for new approaches to make Haiti more sustainable, and rebuilding
projects could improve millions of lives.
The AP found that $874 million of the funds pledged by other countries at the donors conference was money
already promised to Haiti for work or aid before the quake. An additional $1.13 million wasn't ever going to be
sent; it was debt relief. And $184 million was in loans to Haiti's government, not aid.
The Office of the Special Envoy has been tracking the money delivered so far but does not know who got it.
The envoy himself, former President Bill Clinton, told the AP in July and again in August that he was putting
pressure on donors to meet their pledges.

On the streets of Haiti, many simply feel abandoned. Mishna Gregoire, 22, said she was happy when she heard
about the donors conference. But six months later she is still in a tarp city with 5,000 other people, on a foul-
smelling plaza in the Port-au-Prince suburb of Petionville.
""I thought it was something serious they were really going to do,"" Gregoire said, standing amid tarps torn apart
by the sudden storm. ""But nothing has been done. And I don't think anything will be done.""

PESHAWAR (AP) - A local government official said a suicide car bomber attacked a tribal police patrol in northwestern
Pakistan, killing 10 policemen. Rasheed Khan says the attacker rammed his car into a vehicle carrying the police on a
main highway in the Khyber tribal area near the Afghan border. Another 15 people were injured in the attack. No
group has claimed responsibility for the attack, but Taliban militants often target Pakistani security forces.

Wikileaks Accidentally Helps U.S.
by Leslie H. Gelb
November 30, 2010 I 10:42pm
**Julian Assange clearly intended the State Dept. cable leaks to smear the U.S. as evil and selfish. Leslie H. Gelb on how
he inadvertently proved the opposite.**
The Wikileakers dumped a vast pile of secrets to prove that the United States was selfish, stupid and wicked-but their
revelations proved just the opposite. When you remove the gossip and obvious trivia that mesmerized the press, you
clearly see what the Wikileakers never expected: A United States seriously and professionally trying to solve the most
dangerous problems in a frighteningly complicated world, yet lacking the power to dictate solutions. U.S. policymakers
and diplomats are shown, quite accurately, doing what they are supposed to do: ferreting out critical information from
foreign leaders, searching for paths to common action, and struggling with the right amount of pressure to apply on
allies and adversaries. And in most cases, the villain is not Washington, but foreign leaders escaping common action with
cowardice and hypocrisy.

Don't think for a New York minute that Julian Assange, the Wikileaker, unloaded this trove to save humankind. Why did
he toss in those cables about Italy's leader being a rake and Germany's chancellor being a cautious fuddy-duddy, and
President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan being ""paranoid""? To save the world? Not a chance. He did it to get attention,
and he got attention from a drooling press, which then went on to call the very material they were highlighting trivial.
Did Assange leak critical conversations with Chinese or Arab leaders to help solve the problems in Korea and Iran? Not
by the hair on your chinny chin chin. He did it to show that he could do it-and for the attention. Anyone who is not a
hopeless left-wing ideologue knows that such leaks will crush future serious conversations with those leaders for some
time to come. Just think: if you told someone a serious and critical confidence about someone else, and your confidant
went out and told others, would you soon repeat that mistake? Assange did not leak these cables to help solve world
problems. These leaks were absolutely gratuitous and served only the purpose of making him a media marvel.
In explaining his deed publicly, Assange suggests that what he's doing is uncovering American misdeeds and lies. His aim,
he says, is to inform citizens of democracies and peoples around the world about what their leaders are really doing.
Assange also insists he did this for transparency's sake. Yet when he got to look inside, he didn't see what was plain: that
our diplomats were doing a good job. Indeed, when you turn off his nonsense and stop listening to the strange
commentary on cable news and even on the front pages of great newspapers, when you actually read the cables, here's
what you see: American leaders and American diplomats trying to solve crucial world problems.

-Washington needs China's help in bolstering sanctions against Iran, and China balks for fear of jeopardizing its oil and
gas flow from that country. The Obama team arranges for Saudi Arabia to guarantee any loss in supply to China. If the
world wants to slow or even prevent Iran's march to nuclear weaponry, this is a key path to doing so.
-The U.S. discovers that North Korea has manufactured new medium-range missiles and is trying to deliver them to Iran
through China. The Obama team discovers this, informs Beijing, and asks Beijing to stop the transfer. Beijing declines.
Really creepy.
-Yemen's leader takes public responsibility for American missile attacks against Al Qaeda in Yemen. He wants to diminish
the power of these terrorists, as do Americans and most others in the world. The ""lie"" by the Yemeni president is a
harmless way to get a critical job done-that is, the job of fighting international terrorism. Wikileaks tears away the
political cover of Yemen's leaders.
-No country has anywhere near as much influence over nutty North Korea as China. So, U.S. diplomats are searching
desperately to figure out Chinese thinking about North Korea in order to compose a plan for avoiding war on the Korean
Peninsula. So, the Wikileakers expose some Chinese leaders who are actually trying to give us some insight into Chinese
thinking about North Korean craziness. They won't do that again soon.
Time and again, as one actually reads these cables, one has to be heartened by the professionalism and the insights of
U.S. diplomats. What are they doing? They are not lying, and U.S. leaders are not lying. They are actually, believe it or
not, trying to solve problems. That seriousness of purpose and the professionalism to execute it is what jumps out at you
in these materials.
So, the naïve say, it's good to show the effectiveness of our diplomats. Give me a break. Ask any American diplomat to
choose between looking intelligent in leaked cables and making progress toward avoiding war.
None of this is to say that there should not be leaks, or that the press should not pursue classified information that is
necessary or very helpful to a sensible public debate on policy. If a U.S. administration is lying, or distorting the facts, or
telling one story to the public and another to itself, then by all means, let's have it out in public. If the U.S. government is
concocting intelligence in order to justify wars, let's hope an enterprising reporter finds it out for the rest of us.

But the Wikileaks dump is not about providing essential information to Americans or to others-information they need
for serious policy discussion. This massive trashing by Wikileaks of a legitimate effort by the U.S. government to preserve
confidentiality is the very least a shame and at the most, a crime.

Subject: Dear Madam Secretary, Thank you
Madam Secretary:
If you don't know my personal news yet (and I assume that you might through either Huma or Philippe), then here it is: I
Let me say first and foremost: I hope you don't see this as me leaving you or your team. I have asked the question many
times to Philippe and Huma about how you would take this news and the answer has always been the same - that you
would be happy for me - and I truly do hope that this is the case. The truth is that I applied while working in PA/PL and
was eventually wait listed and usually when wait listed you are not given the option to defer. That is neither here nor
there, but Philippe and Huma have both been incredible mentors to me throughout this entire decision-making process,
and for this, I am most grateful to them both.
The decision was not an easy one. First, Madam Secretary, you know when we first met: Believe it or not, it has been
over ten years now, You have not only been a role model and a
mentor for me throughout the years, but I have watched you behind closed doors; out in public; and quite frankly, I have
watched you both win and lose. And whether winning or losing, you are courageous: no matter what, you are
determined and inspirational.
I have seen many people join your team, leave your team, some work for a few years, others for many - and everyone
says they will still be ""part of the family."" Some seem to remain in touch; others don't. I see myself as a little different;
maybe you don't. Both you and President Clinton have watched me grow since I was young. More than anything, I truly
hope to remain a ""part of the family.""
Sometimes people ask me why I have been dedicated to working for you for so many years. It is not for fame or glory.
The truth is, I have worked for you because I have always believed in you. You are one of a kind -
there is no other one like you, and there never will be. I truly believe that the world needs you in whatever capacity that
you are in. And more than anything, I am most appreciative and thankful for all that you have offered me: Not only the
mentorship and guidance but the continuous opportunities to learn. On my own path of public service, I can truly say
that I was able to learn time and time again from the very best.
Parting from your team is thus not an easy task for me, especially leaving Philippe's direct team, where I really enjoy
what I am doing. But I also feel that I want to take another next step forward/a different one in my own life. And I am
hopeful that this is not a permanent goodbye in any way. I hope that you and I can remain in touch via email, and I
promise not to email too often, as I know how busy you are.

But I must reiterate one comment that I made: I have worked for you for so long for a reason: Not for my resume. Not
for myself, But because of you. I am confident enough to say that I know you well enough to tell others that I have
worked for the most brilliant mind and strongest leader I will ever see in my lifetime. And I am incredibly proud of that.
With eternal thanks and appreciation, of which cannot be summed up in words, let alone in an email,
My best, always,

I agree. As you know I believe passionately that it is not in our national interests to continue to provide billions of dollars
in aid and assistance without the very people we are helping knowing we are the ones providing the assistance. Some of
our research in Pakistan indicates that many people believe the assistancee is coming from China and of course the
Chinese do nothing to correct the record.
I asked INR to provide me with an assessment of the current situation after the floods to determine the impact of our
assistance. I have also asked them to work with the IC to give us an accurate and unbiased assessment of the security
risks involved. I aksed for it a couple of weeks ago so hopefully they will have something we can use now which might be
helpful in drafting a response.
In terms of the security arguments he makes, it is worth noting that the incidents he references are situations where the
attacks occured in places where there was NO USG branding. The reality is that the terrorists attack any group or
institution which might impede their ability to prevail.
I had already planned a USAID/State meeting to address this issue this week. I'll try to get everyone together today or
tomorrow and will report back to you.

Interaction op-ed that Raj Shah was told will appear in the Washington Post also appeared in Sunday Daily Times in
Pakistan.
by Samuel A. Worthington
The work that relief and humanitarian organizations carry out in Pakistan is far from easy or safe. We go to difficult areas
and are targets for militants seeking to destroy our lifesaving mission through a campaign of killing, kidnapping and
intimidation.
Overtly branding our efforts as sponsored by the U.S. government — as the Obama administration wants us to do —
only makes our jobs harder and more dangerous.
I have the privilege of leading InterAction, an alliance of U.S.-based nongovernmental organizations conducting relief
work around the world; nearly a quarter of our 200 members are responding to the recent floods in Pakistan, and many
of them have been in Pakistan for decades.
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05772633 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05772633 Date: 08/31/2015
Though our efforts are supported by public donations, much of the assistance we deliver — whether food, water,
essential health care or education — comes via funding from the U.S. government. And in recent weeks, the Obama
administration has pressured us to make that link as clear and public as possible. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham
Clinton questioned our courage, suggesting last month that some NGOs are too ""afraid to have association with the U.S.
government"" while distributing aid in Pakistan.
None of the NGO workers in Pakistan — living under a daily threat of kidnappings or targeted killings — are cowards.
The dangers they face are immense, and their bravery must be commended as they help people whose lives have been
devastated by terrorism or the epic floods.
Of course, I understand where the administration is coming from. The U.S.-funded assistance we provide saves lives and
helps struggling communities rebuild. In the battle for hearts and minds in Pakistan, U.S. officials argue, the failure to
clearly advertise that the American government is behind this help — with, for instance, logos on medicines or signs on
food-distribution centers — is a missed opportunity. In 2009 the United States approved $7.5 billion in assistance to
Pakistan over the next five years; however, as Washington Post columnist David Ignatius noted recently, Pakistanis read
more about American drone attacks than about these aid dollars.
In countries such as Liberia or Democratic Republic of Congo, U.S. NGOs that get funding from the U.S. government
routinely promote the fact that they are delivering help ""from the American people."" But in Pakistan, where aid workers'
lives are more often at stake, an enforced branding campaign could undermine our ability to deliver assistance as fast as
possible without being a lightning rod for protests or attacks. It would also put the lives of Americans and their Pakistani
colleagues at risk. (It is usually Pakistani nationals who do the bulk of the work on the ground.)
In an environment where we are often soft targets for militants, drawing attention to our connection to the U.S.
government makes us even more vulnerable.
In March, one of InterAction's most active members in Pakistan, World Vision — which works on issues from health care
to farming to literacy — was attacked in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (formerly called the North-West Frontier Province), and
seven of its employees were killed. And a year ago, the office of the World Food Program in Islamabad was attacked,
and five employees were killed.
There must be a balance among mitigating the risks NGOs face, communicating U.S. goodwill and delivering assistance
effectively. NGOs must be allowed to strike that balance on their own every day — even if the upshot is that we don't
include U.S. signs on new health clinics.
In some cases, particularly in less-volatile regions of Pakistan, conspicuously identifying aid as American may not pose a
threat to our work. But in areas where militants are particularly active, the risks to those delivering the aid may be great.
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05772633 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05772633 Date: 08/31/2015
These judgments must be made by the NGOs on the ground, depending on local circumstances, and not directed by the
State Department's branding concerns.
In Pakistani tribal areas along the Afghan border, for instance, the U.S. Agency for International Development has
granted our members waivers allowing us not to brand U.S. assistance, but there is growing pressure by the government
for these waivers to be phased out. While I agree that U.S. aid to the Pakistani people and government needs to be more
visible, this could put humanitarian workers' lives in jeopardy.
The American people are enormously generous, as shown after Haiti's devastating earthquake in January and in the
aftermath of the December 2004 tsunami in Asia. In Pakistan, the United States — through military and civilian
assistance, as well as through NGOs — is playing a major role in response to the recent floods, which forced at least 15
million people from their homes. The humanitarian groups I represent are providing basics, including clean water,
medicine and shelter.
The debate over branding our efforts is not simply another technical policy decision; for us, it can be a matter of life and
death. NGOs and the Obama administration must work together to find a solution that allows humanitarian workers in
the field flexibility to brand or not, according to security conditions on the ground.
We are ready and eager to have that dialogue. The lives of our front-line workers depend on it.
Samuel A. Worthington is president of InterAction, an alliance of U.S.-based nongovernmental organizations carrying out
international humanitarian and development work.

Lynn,
I was trying to reach you to tell you and Teddy that I asked Tony Blair to go to Israel as part of our full court press on
keeping the Middle East negotiations going. He told me that he had a commitment in Aspen w you two and the
conference, but after we talked, he decided to go and asked me to tell you. He is very sorry, obviously, but I'm grateful
that he accepted my request. I hope you all understand and give him a raincheck.
If you were interested, he might be able to satellite in if you have the technology available.
He should land around Sam Aspen time. Let me know what penance I owe you. And pls explain to Teddy. As ever, H

Subject: (Haaretz) Palestinians expected to leave direct talks
(Haaretz) - The Palestinian leadership plans to meet October 2 and is expected to officially decide to end
negotiations with Israel if the renewed West Bank settlement construction is not halted. Those expected
to attend the meeting include representatives of the PLO workers committee, the Fatah central committee,
and the heads of other political parties. After making a decision, the Palestinian leadership is expected to
announce that the final decision of whether to leave the talks will be made by the Arab League, who are
planning to discuss the issue October 4. The head of the Palestinian negotiation team, Saeb Erekat, said
""there are no half-way solutions on the settlements issue."" In a statement released to the press after
meeting with U.S. Consul General Daniel Rubinstein, Erekat called on the American government and the
European Union to force Israel to stop all construction in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, in order to
give peace a chance. Egyptian Foreign Minister Ahmed Aboul Gheit said the Palestinians would not be
able to remain in the peace talks after Israel's decision not to extend the moratorium. Gheit added that
""despite the international efforts, I am not optimistic [about peace talks]"".

Hi Lona, I just saw the S video for Mother's Day: After nearly 10 years of working for the Department, this ranks as one
of my proudest, most fulfilling moments of serving as a Foreign Service Officer.
Clearly I'm not the only one who has made these sacrifices or who has these frustrations; Secretary Clinton has heard
our struggles (indeed has gone through her own struggles as a professional mom!), and she truly gets it.
I just wanted to tell somebody, and I remembered your name from the women's conference in December. Forgive this
long message. Happy Mother's Day, and congratulations on working with such an incredible person.

JERUSALEM (AP) - Palestinians are expressing strong reservations about a U.S. proposal meant to entice Israel to
reinstate limits on West Bank settlement construction and revive peace talks. Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat did not
reject the proposal outright, but said a decision on whether to endorse it would be made after consultations with
Palestinian and Arab leaders. Erekat says the Palestinians ""have a major problem in not including east Jerusalem.""

Re: Iran, Saudi
Had dinner last night (Tuesday, February 16) with Joschka Fischer. We had an interesting
conversation on Iran and Saudi Arabia, among other things. (As you know Fischer is now
director of the Nabucco pipeline project.) On Iran, harsh, targeted sanctions are absolutely
necessary, but are most effective diplomatically when always coupled with an offer to negotiate.
The iron fist in the velvet glove approach achieves several objectives: According to Fischer's
intelligence, Ahmanijehad wished some negotiated settlement but was blocked. The regime has
splits at the top. Perhaps true, perhaps not. But constantly pushing negotiations alongside
sanctions puts additional pressure on internal divisions, whatever they are. Extending an open
hand while brandishing a stick closes diplomatic and political room to maneuver for Iran. Its
refusal to accept the open hand justifies application of the stick. Even when sanctions are
enforced it always remains useful to say another way is open. The damage done to Iran is
therefore the result of its own choice. This approach also aids the opposition. A purely condign
sanctions strategy can contribute to the regime's will to punish and tighten repression. Talking of
regime change, of course, undermines the cause of regime change. It is a gift to the regime. The
opposition is a new factor in the Iran equation that must be taken into account on the political
and moral level. Pushed to the wall, the regime may feel compelled to repress, which might
involve thousands or tens of thousands of political killings. On Saudi Arabia, Fischer points out
that if Iran develops nuclear weaponry the Saudis already have their own bomb. The Saudis
invested in Pakistan's nuclear weaponry partly for this eventuality; that's their bomb in reserve.

Another Republican senator signaled Tuesday that he may vote for the new arms control treaty with Russia if it comes
up for a vote before the Senate adjourns for the year later this month.
Senator Judd Gregg of New Hampshire, who did not run for re-election, said he hopes that the Senate will get a chance
to vote on the treaty, known as New Start, right after a deal on tax cuts and a spending resolution to keep the
government operating.
""Start is an important issue. It should be fully debated. I am leaning towards supporting it,"" he told Andrea Mitchell on
MSNBC. ""I haven't made a final decision,"" he added, noting that Senator Jon Kyl of Arizona, the lead Republican
negotiator on the treaty, still has concerns. ""He has some reservations, but I believe many of those reservations are
being addressed,"" Mr. Gregg said.
President Obama has made passing the treaty his top foreign policy priority for the lame-duck session. Under the
Constitution, approving a treaty requires a two-thirds super-majority, or 67 votes, meaning that Mr. Obama needs nine
Republicans assuming all 58 Democrats stick with him.

3 bombs devastated the shrine of Data Ganjbakhsh (the most sacred Muslim place in all of South Asia, and the shrine S
was supposed to go to). Aside from loss of life, this is a major blow to Pakistan. I recommend that you call Qureshi,
Nawaz and Pasha (who will be here tomorrow). This will either break Pakistanis or will get them into the fight. This
shrine is deeply tied to the foundation of Islam in Pakistan.

FYI, from WHA:
Mexican law enforcement officials cannot stop individuals and require proof of migratory status. However, like SB1070,
officials in the course of official ""contact"" (i.e. Traffic stops, investigations, hot pursuit) are authorized to request proof
of migratory status. They do this in practice routinely. Frequently, individuals who cannot prove legal status are referred
to INM (federal CBP-equivalent). In practice, GoM authorities at all levels engage in exploitative treatment of migrants,
primarily Central Americans heading to the US. These abuses have been well documented by international human rights
groups, as well as by multiple documentary and news media reports.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazilian President Lula da Silva said he would not extradite former Italian guerrilla
Cesare Battisti, a move that could damage relations with Italy. Brazil's Supreme Court had ruled last year that
Battisti should be extradited on murder convictions from the 1970s in Italy, but it left the final decision to Lula.
The move, announced in a statement released by the Brazilian government, was widely expected and comes a
day after Italian Prime Minister Berlusconi warned that such a decision would be ""incomprehensible and
unacceptable."" Brazilian media reported any decision still had to be verified by the Supreme Court but it was
not immediately clear whether this was just a formality.

Just FYI on the below, from one of those crazy right ""magazines"" - notes that the home you referenced in your Prayer
Breakfast remarks has since closed.
I checked in with Lissa & Melanne, they didn't know it closed, which makes sense since it happened in 2002 after you left
the White House.
I made it clear that your longtime commitment to this issue - throughout your public career - is well known, and you
remain very proud of your work with Mother Teresa in opening this home in 1995. And that your partnership is a
success story to be emulated.
Again, this is just FYI

ADOPTION I Hillary Clinton continues to hail an adoption home she helped open with Mother Teresa that has since
closed its doors By Emily Belz
WASHINGTON—An adoption ministry Secretary of State Hillary Clinton hailed as a home she helped open with Mother
Teresa no longer handles adoptions and its phone line has been disconnected, though at last week's National Prayer
Breakfast Clinton spent five minutes of her 30-minute speech relating the story of its opening. Last Thursday Clinton
described Mother Teresa ""beaming about what this meant for children and their futures,"" seemingly oblivious that the
Mother Teresa Home for Infant Children in northwest Washington, D.C., is now defunct. She said she worked tirelessly
to ""cut through all the red tape,"" although it appears that red tape prevented the work from continuing. According to a
pastor at the church next door to the home's former location, the adoption ministry failed to take off because the
Roman Catholic nuns who ran it weren't allowed to care for babies without medical personnel on site. ""I'm not sure the
legal thing that came down upon them, but they realized they needed to expend their energies in another way,"" said
Maureen Freshour, who along with her husband, David, pastors Chevy Chase Baptist Church and lives nearby. Freshour
has stayed in touch with the nuns from the Missionaries of Charity order who ran the home and said that the remaining
three or four sisters have moved to another house in Washington, where they are ministering to the homeless.""This has
been a core issue—adoption—whether the home [Clinton] talked about survived or not,"" said Chuck Johnson, chief
operating officer of the National Council for Adoption. ""It's an issue she's been consistent on.""During her speech on
Thursday, Clinton reminisced about the 1994 National Prayer Breakfast when she attended as first lady and Mother
Teresa was the speaker. The Roman Catholic nun delivered a blistering speech about abortion, saying, ""Any country that
accepts abortion is not teaching its people to love, but to use any violence to get what they want."" Mother Teresa then

called on attendees to fight abortion through adoption: ""Please don't kill the child. I want the child. Please give me the
child.""The audience that day gave her a standing ovation—but President and Mrs. Clinton, both pro-abortion, did not
stand. Afterward, Mother Teresa asked to meet with Hillary Clinton and they went to talk behind a curtain on the stage,
sitting on folding chairs, Mother Teresa in sandals even though it was winter.""She told me that she knew that we had a
shared conviction about adoption being vastly better as a choice for unplanned or unwanted babies,"" Clinton related last
Thursday. ""And she asked me—or more properly, she directed me—to work with her to create a home for such babies
here in Washington.""Clinton followed through and set up a home for unwanted babies in Washington in just over a year,
no small feat in a city that was known then for its inefficient and corrupt bureaucracy. The Mother Teresa Home for
Infant Children opened in June 1995 in the district's affluent Chevy Chase neighborhood to house eight pregnant
mothers and their babies—but it remains unclear whether it facilitated any adoptions.I called the Missionaries of Charity
in Washington, a worldwide Roman Catholic order established by Mother Teresa. The nun who answered the phone said
she couldn't give her name because they aren't allowed to talk to the press. She did say, however, that the sisters who
are in the order now were not in the order when the adoption home opened, so she wasn't sure why it closed. She
added that the order sold the Chevy Chase house in 2002. ""We work with the poor and we didn't have any work there
because it's a rich neighborhood,"" she said. The sisters, she added, are now working with the homeless and those with
AIDS in a more transitional neighborhood in the northeast section of town on Otis Street.

IRAQ BURIN (AP) - Palestinians say extremist Jews damaged their olive trees close to a West Bank village as the yearly
harvest of the important crop begins. Resident Bilal Eid said that two dozen men from a nearby Jewish settlement tore
at about a dozen trees after trying to attack Palestinians bulldozing an access road to their fields. The attack came at the
beginning of the 40-day Palestinian olive harvest. It's traditionally a time of heightened violence, as a minority of
extremist Jews try to provoke Palestinians. Eid said the damage could kill the trees, which were meant to be harvested
this week, near the village of Burin. A military spokeswoman said Israeli forces ordered the Jewish intruders to leave.

Over the last year, the United States has worked with our international partners to build on the progress achieved at the
climate change conference in Copenhagen. We have pressed for substantive steps that would advance the vision of the
Copenhagen Accord. This month we joined the nations of the world in Cancun for a new round of talks aimed at
mobilizing common action to meet the shared global challenge of climate change.
Today I am pleased to announce that we secured the Cancun Agreements, a set of balanced international decisions
under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC) which represent meaningful progress in
our global response to climate change.
These agreements advance each of the core elements of the Copenhagen Accord: They anchor the Accord's mitigation
pledges; build on a system of transparency with substantial detail and content of International Consultations and
Analysis which will provide confidence that a country's pledges are being carried out; launch a new Green Climate Fund;
create a framework to reduce deforestation in developing countries; establish a technology mechanism; and Setup a

KABUL (Reuters) - The commander of U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan, General David Petraeus, has ordered a probe
into the death of a British aid worker killed during a rescue bid by U.S. forces, the U.S. military said. ""Initial reports
indicated the explosion was caused by a detonation triggered by one of the captors who was in close proximity to Linda
Norgrove. Subsequent review of surveillance footage and discussions with members of the rescue team do not
conclusively determine the cause of her death,"" it said. The statement comes shortly after British Prime Minister David
Cameron told a news conference Norgrove may have been killed by a grenade from foreign forces during the rescue
operation.

The allegation against Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus of 'diverting foreign aid from Grameen Bank to another
company' should be investigated, the prime minister has said.
""Bangladesh has set many examples. Deceiving people by siphoning off their money is another such example. This is
nothing but sucking out money from the people after giving them loans,"" she said replying to questions from journalists
on Sunday.
""There has been no improvement in the lifestyle of the poor so far. They were just used as pawns to get more aids,""
Hasina added.
She was speaking at a press conference at her office on Sunday following her three-nation tour of Russia, Belgium and
Japan.
""The people of Bangladesh have been made guinea pigs. I have never supported that. And now I protest,"" Hasina told
journalists.
Naimul Islam Khan, editor of Amader Shomoy, said, ""Initially, the government had 60 percent share of the Grameen
Bank which now has shrunk to 25 percent. It seems Mr Yunus wanted to empty the government exchequer, if he could.
The government, however, didn't let that happen.""
He also asked whether the government would investigate the allegation raised against Yunus and his Grameen Bank.
Responding to the query, the prime minister said, ""Grameen Bank had been grabbed in such a manner as if it's a
personal property. This should also be investigated. The poor people are becoming paupers. They have been tricked by
sweet talks. Finally, things are getting out.""
Hasina compared Khaleda Zia's 'affection' for her cantonment house with Yunus' affection' for his Grameen Bank and
said, ""Grameen Bank is a public property. But it's being privatised out of 'love'. Yunus Sahib has fallen in love with
Grameen Bank.

""One can't but get caught if play with the money of the poor,"" she added.
Norway's national TV NRK aired a documentary on November 30 titled ""Fanget i Mikrogjeld"" or ""Caught in Micro debt"",
based on which bdnews24.com ran a report on December 1.
According to the documentary, Yunus transferred the money to Grameen Kalyan, which was in no way involved with
microcredit operations.
Responding to the allegations, Grameen Bank claimed there was no wrongdoing in the agreement between the bank
and Grameen Kalyan under which it received Tk 3,917 million from the bank.
""Decisions were taken by the Grameen Bank Board, with due deliberation, good faith, and with good intentions to
benefit the poor,"" the Grameen Bank rejoinder said.

He has been incorporating fine-tuning edits today. I will email you a draft shortly, which will be tweaked

Also, I just saw on the schedule I was expected to speak for only 12 minutes. I think the speech as written is longer but I

HRC: Below is ah oped on the National Security Strategy I wrote for tomorrow's Outlook.
Unfortunately, they give it a horrible title, but I think the piece turned out alright.
Best, Sandy
By Samuel R. Berger
Samuel R. Berger, chair of the global strategy firm Albright Stonebridge Group, served as national security advisor to
President Clinton from 1997 to 2001.
President Obama's National Security Strategy, released by the White House on Thursday, tackles a delicate but
unavoidable question: How do we respond to new and old security challenges in an era of financial distress at home and
a reordering of political power abroad?
For some time now, it has been clear that the definition of U.S. national security strategy needs rethinking. The
September 11 attacks, global economic crisis, cyber-terror threats and even the environmental catastrophe in the Gulf
underscore that the challenges America faces in 2010 have changed even from just a decade ago. And while America's
military supremacy is certainly not at risk, new international arrangements - such as the shift from the G-7 club of
powerful nations to the G-20, which incorporates emerging nations from China to Brazil - are needed so that the costs
and benefits of a stable international order are shared. The United States cannot solve most global threats without
others, nor should we bear the burden alone.
Enter the National Security Strategy. In my experience, these congressionally mandated documents can easily become
laborious and impenetrable, or mere compendiums of bureaucratic pleading from various parts of the government.
(Make sure you do right by Japan! Don't step on the Pentagon!) The challenge, which President Clinton insisted upon to
me and his other advisers, is to provide a strategic framework that is clarifying to the rest of the world and informs

administration decision makers up and down the line. It's not a blueprint for action, but a means to convey the
president's principles and priorities.
In Obama's case, the new sober and comprehensive 52-page strategy incorporates the new realities and breaks with
past strategies in several key respects. But it also reflects an understanding that we face enduring challenges - nuclear
proliferation, terrorism and regional conflicts - for which the best response is a return to fundamentals.
One such fundamental is the strength of our economy. At a time when the after-effects of a financial crisis and the fiscal
burden of two long wars have raised fears of an overextended America, the administration makes a case for economic
and technological renewal as a crucial underpinning of U.S. security. The president made this case in his West Point
speech last weekend. ""At no time in human history,"" he said, ""has a nation of diminished economic vitality maintained
its military and political primacy.""
Another fundamental challenge is arms control and nuclear proliferation. By seeking strategic arms cuts with Russia, the
president has returned to a long bipartisan tradition that languished during the prior administration. And by convening a
global summit on securing nuclear material this spring, Obama has given new urgency and global purchase to the effort
started in 1991 when Sens. Sam Nunn and Richard Lugar first initiated a program to lock down nuclear materials.
On terrorism, the strategy builds on the past, but breaks with it as well. Presidents Clinton, Bush and Obama each have
deployed all of America's tools: military power, homeland defense, law enforcement, sanctions, intelligence and
vigorous efforts to cut off terrorist financing. But the critical difference in the Obama strategy is that it rejects the Global
War on Terror lens through which the prior administration viewed the challenge. ""This is not a global war against a tactic
- terrorism - or a religion - Islam,"" the new strategy says. ""We are at war with a specific network, al-Qaeda and its
terrorist affiliates.""
This sharper focus avoids alienating many in the Muslim world, ensures the support of key allies who never accepted the
broader construct and avoids the overreactions that led us to forsake the fight against aI-Qaeda fight in Afghanistan and
turn our efforts to the unrelated threat from Saddam Hussein's Iraq.
In perhaps the most dramatic departure from the strategy of its predecessor, the Obama administration has restored a
less provocative policy on the use of military force. In the 2002 national security strategy, President Bush articulated the
rationale for preemptive war just weeks before seeking a U.N. resolution to invade Iraq. The new strategy restores the
principles that have guided administrations for decades: the use of force should be a last resort, should weigh all the
costs and benefits, and should have as much international support as possible. The administration reserves the right to
act unilaterally - for example against al-Qaeda and its allies - but resurrects the principle President Clinton often
described as ""together where possible, alone where necessary.""
President Obama's critics have focused on his diplomatic engagement with hostile states like Iran and North Korea. The
President sets forth his rationale: ""to create opportunities to resolve differences, strengthen the international
community's support for our actions, learn about the intentions and nature of closed regimes, and plainly demonstrate
to the public within those nations that their governments are to blame for their isolation.""
In the case of Iran, Washington's outstretched hand has not resulted in Iran's compliance. But attempts to engage have
helped ensure that the world's attention is focused on Iran's intransigence rather than Washington's refusal to
negotiate.

Without a doubt, there are gaps between principle and practice. Despite the Obama administration's stated goal of
doubling exports in the next five years, it has not put its muscle behind trade agreements with South Korea, Panama and
Colombia. And the clarity of its call to respect human rights has at times been muted in the face of tough realities.
Sixteen months into this administration there has been much progress, but many of the true tests of this strategy lie
ahead.
In the strategy's conclusions, the Obama administration evokes an even earlier era, calling for both political parties to
restore the cooperation and common purpose so crucial to our success during the dark days of the Cold War. Despite
the intense debates at the time over nuclear arms control, Central America and détente, nearly all American supported
the containment of communism.
In that same spirit, the administration's framework deserves broad bipartisan support. We can and should argue out our
differences over detention of prisoners, methods to disarm dangerous states, how hard to push for democratic rights, or
the costs of climate change legislation. But at the same time, we can rally around the overriding U.S. foreign policy goals
spelled out in the strategy: renewing our economy at home to ensure leadership abroad; defeating al-Qaeda; succeeding
in Afghanistan; preventing nuclear proliferation; curbing climate change; and promoting an international order of
enlightened self-interest, economic prosperity and the fundamental values upon which America is based.

The Big (Military) Taboo
By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF
<http://topics.nytimes.com/top/opinion/editorialsandoped/oped/columnists/nicholasdkristof/index.html?inline=nyt-
per>
We face wrenching budget cutting in the years ahead, but there's one huge area of government spending that
Democrats and Republicans alike have so far treated as sacrosanct.
It's the military/security world, and it's time to bust that taboo. A few facts:
• The United States spends nearly as much on military power
<http://www.sipri.org/research/armaments/milex/resultoutput/trends> as every other country in the world combined,
according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. It says that we spend more than six times as much
<http://www.sipri.org/research/armaments/milex/resultoutput/trendgraphs/Top1Obubble/top1Obubble2009/image_vi
ewfullscreen> as the country with the next highest budget, China.
• The United States maintains troops at more than 560 bases and other sites abroad, many of them a legacy of a world
war that ended 65 years ago. Do we fear that if we pull our bases from Germany, Russia might invade?
• The intelligence community is so vast that more people have ""top secret"" clearance than live in Washington, D.C.
• The U.S. will spend more on the war in Afghanistan this year
<http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/29/opinion/29kristof.html>, adjusting for inflation, than we spent on the
Revolutionary War, the War of 1812, the Mexican-American War, the Civil War and the Spanish-American War
combined.
This is the one area where elections scarcely matter. President Obama, a Democrat who symbolized new directions,
requested about 6 percent <http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/23/us/politics/23budget.html? _r=3> more for the
military this year than at the peak of the Bush administration.
""Republicans think banging the war drums wins them votes, and Democrats think if they don't chime in, they'll lose
votes,"" said Andrew Bacevich, an ex-military officer who now is a historian at Boston University. He is author of a
thoughtful recent book, ""Washington Rules: America's Path to Permanent War.""
The costs of excessive reliance on military force are not just financial, of course, as Professor Bacevich knows well. His
son, Andrew Jr., an Army first lieutenant, was killed in Iraq in 2007.
Let me be clear: I'm a believer in a robust military, which is essential for backing up diplomacy. But the implication is that
we need a balanced tool chest of diplomatic and military tools alike. Instead, we have a billionaire military and a pauper
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773755 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773755 Date: 08/31/2015
diplomacy. The U.S. military now has more people in its marching bands than the State Department has in its foreign
service — and that's preposterous.
What's more, if you're carrying an armload of hammers, every problem looks like a nail. The truth is that military power
often isn't very effective at solving modern problems, like a nuclear North Korea or an Iran that is on the nuclear path.
Indeed, in an age of nationalism, our military force is often counterproductive.
After the first gulf war, the United States retained bases in Saudi Arabia on the assumption that they would enhance
American security. Instead, they appear to have provoked fundamentalists like Osama bin Laden into attacking the U.S.
In other words, hugely expensive bases undermined American security (and we later closed them anyway). Wouldn't our
money have been better spent helping American kids get a college education?
Paradoxically, it's often people with experience in the military who lead the way in warning against overinvestment in
arms. It was President Dwight Eisenhower who gave the strongest warning: ""Every gun that is made, every warship
launched, every rocket fired signifies, in the final sense, a theft from those who hunger and are not fed, those who are
cold and are not clothed."" And in the Obama administration, it is Defense Secretary Robert Gates who has argued that
military spending on things large and small can and should expect closer, harsher scrutiny; it is Secretary Gates who has
argued most eloquently for more investment in diplomacy and development aid.
American troops in Afghanistan are among the strongest advocates of investing more in schools there because they see
firsthand that education fights extremism far more effectively than bombs. And here's the trade-off: For the cost of one
American soldier in Afghanistan for one year, you could build about 20 schools.
There are a few signs of hope in the air. The Simpson-Bowles deficit commission proposes cutting money for
armaments, along with other spending. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton unveiled a signature project, the quadrennial
diplomacy and development review, which calls for more emphasis on aid and diplomacy in foreign policy.
""Leading through civilian power saves lives and money,"" Mrs. Clinton noted, and she's exactly right. The review is a great
document, but we'll see if it can be implemented — especially because House Republicans are proposing cuts in the
State Department budget.
They should remind themselves that in the 21st century, our government can protect its citizens in many ways: financing
research against disease, providing early childhood programs that reduce crime later, boosting support for community
colleges, investing in diplomacy that prevents costly wars.
As we cut budgets, let's remember that these steps would, on balance, do far more for the security of Americans than a
military base in Germany.

You have graciously facilitated a couple of meetings between me and Secretary Clinton and I need to express my thanks.
Today is my last day as the US Security Coordinator for Israel/Palestine and I would be grateful if you could pass my
appreciation for S's support these past two years. Our Ambassadors in Jordan and Israel think it would be useful for me
to give her a summary of where I see things after almost 5 years here in Jerusalem, but I do not wish to intrude.
However, should she want to chat, I will be on pre-retirement leave in the DC area until mid-November.
Thanks again for the assistance along the way.

After the arrest, other residents started throwing rocks at the police forces. One policeman was hit in the head with a
rock and was injured. He was treated on the scene. The police fired two warning shots into the air and the crowd
dispersed.
In a separate incident also on September 26, a molotov cocktail was thrown at police and border patrol forces on patrol
in the Givati parking lot near the entrance to Silwan and the City of David. The molotov cocktail exploded but there were
no injuries.
A sweep of the area by border patrol found three other molotov cocktails and three suspects were arrested.

TEHRAN (AP) - Venezuelan President Chavez has arrived in Tehran for talks with Iranian leaders expected to focus on
efforts to boost cooperation between the allies oil, gas and petrochemical industries.
Iranian state television says Chavez was greeted by Industry Minister Ali Akbar Mehrabian at Tehran's Mehrabad
airport upon arrival early October 19.
State TV says Chavez will hold talks with President Ahmadinejad, during his two-day visit.
The Venezuelan leader backed Iran in its confrontation with the West over Tehran's disputed nuclear program. The
U.S. accuses Iran of seeking to develop an atomic bomb. Iran says its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes.

I would love to catch up. I have to be in DC from the 12th-15th May, in case you have any time to sneak away for a few
minutes.
I understand it may not be possible, but thought I would check.
In any event, I remain your loyal adoring pal.

Gordon Brown called Lou Susman a short while ago. Brown believes you should make a call to McGuinness this morning
around 830 am (DecIan and I agree that if you call McG you also must call Robinson). Brown proposes to speak with you
at 820 or so to bring you up to speed before those calls.
The current situation is that Brown and Cowen are in Belfast, and met with Robinson, McGuinness, and other parties
until 330 in the morning Belfast time. They have now resumed today. The sticking point is parades. Robinson wants the
current parades commission abolished because it gives Republicans too much say. McGuinness refuses to allow the
parades issue to be tied to the devolution issue.
The key message to McGuinness is to keep working this thing through -- not to take any drastic action that would bring
down the assembly or collapse the process.
DecIan agrees that this is the moment to make calls.
If you agree we can have the ops center set up the Brown call as well as the other two.
We'll get you some more background before the calls, but talking points will be fluid and shaped in large measure by
Brown's report.

A PALI PAPA..PONYET PREVAL GONFLE
Preval rejects US advice on presidential election
By JONATHAN M. KATZ (AP) — 2 hours ago
PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti — Haiti's president on Wednesday rejected U.S. Senate recommendations on holding an election
for his successor, brushing off criticism that the current process will leave the shattered country without a credible
leader.
A report issued this month by Sen. Richard Lugar, the ranking Republican on the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations
Committee, ""strongly encourages"" Haiti to let its international partners help restructure the eight-member Provisional
Electoral Council, which has been accused of corruption.
The report also recommends ensuring the participation of the key opposition party of ousted former President Jean-
Bertrand Aristide, which was blocked from participating in 2009 legislative contests because of a dispute over rival
candidate lists.
On Tuesday, President Rene Preval fulfilled one recommendation of the report by issuing a signed decree setting
election day for Nov. 28.
But speaking at a news conference in an open-air gazebo alongside the broken remains of the national palace a day
later, Preval told reporters he had no intention of complying with the rest, including changing the election body, known
as the CEP.
""I'm not doing the CEP with international partners. I'm doing the CEP with national partners,"" Preval said. ""The senator's
proposition is inadmissible.""
Seeking to show the council was not ""hand-picked,"" as he said in English, Preval handed out copies of nomination letters
for the panel's members submitted by various national and religious organizations, including the National Council of
Political Parties, Roman Catholic Church and National Confederation of Haitian Vodou.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05775309 Date: 08/31/2015
He also defended the prohibition on the exiled Aristide's Fanmi Lavalas party in last year's elections, a ban that came
after rival factions of the party submitted competing lists of candidates.
""International donors need to look for an accord with the CEP and the political parties and the factions of Fanmi
Lavalas,"" Preval said. ""We are giving (the parties) the support that they need, and the factions need to figure it out (for
themselves).""
Preval did not discuss the forced resignation of an electoral council member accused of stealing a staffer's pay or
opponents' allegations that the council gave special privileges to the president's newly formed Unity Party ahead of
planned Feb. 28 legislative elections, which were postponed because of the Jan. 12 earthquake that devastated the
capital.
He also declined to answer questions about another U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee report that criticizes
Haiti's earthquake recovery, saying he would address that issue at a news conference on reconstruction next week.
Elections have never been easy in Haiti, a country whose founding president crowned himself emperor. It took 186 years
to hold what the international community considered a democratic election in 1990, which was then closely followed by
a coup d'etat.
Preval, in fact, is the only Haitian ever to be elected president, serve a full term and hand off power to an elected
successor. Unable to run for re-election in the November contest, he pledged to relinquish power again as he did in the
1990s — after protesters alleged earlier this year that he was dragging his feet on holding presidential the election.
Doing so will require significant help. The electoral council's headquarters were destroyed and its records lost in the
quake, while millions of voters were either killed, made homeless or displaced. Its new headquarters is a former Gold's
Gym seized by drug agents.
The election will also be a cost burden for this grindingly poor Caribbean nation: $29 million according to electoral
officials at the news conference with Preval, $38 million according to the U.S. Senate report.
The Organization of American States and United Nations have pledged support. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon
issued a statement Wednesday praising the decree setting the election date and pledged the help of U.N. peacekeepers
and advisers in preparing and supporting the ballot. Ban urged member states to quickly provide the money needed to
run the vote.

I was trying to reach you to tell you and Teddy that I asked Tony Blair to go to Israel as part of our full court press on
keeping the Middle East negotiations going. He told me that he had a commitment in Aspen w you two and the
conference, but after we talked, he decided to go and asked me to tell you. He is very sorry, obviously, but I'm grateful
that he accepted my request. I hope you all understand and give him a raincheck.
If you were interested, he might be able to satellite in if you have the technology available.
He should land around Sam Aspen time. Let me know what penance I owe you. And pls explain to Teddy. As ever, H
