Cheryl;
As a postscript to what you mentioned about Haiti efforts being the prime example of a new form of shared
responsibility in the region and how Haiti reconstruction going forward can serve as the basis for this
organizing principle, I want to share some additional thoughts to support your point with the hope that Haiti
becomes a major theme of S's trip. To my knowledge, all the countries in the region (from richest to poorest)
have contributed in some form or another to the relief efforts. This is unprecedented in this region. And given
that this effort relates to Haiti in particular, it is even more remarkable. As you know, Haiti since its
independence in 1804 has often been seen by the rest of the region as a second class nation. As the Spanish-
speaking nations of South America gained independence in the 1820s, they excluded Haiti from their designs
for regional union — mostly out of fear by the Latins of slave revolts and uprisings by their own black and
indigenous populations. (Of course, we have had our own complex and unfortunate relationship with Haiti.) As
has been demonstrated by the recent UNASUR and Grupo Rio sessions, the same cannot be said of the region
today. And of the countries S is visiting, Chile is the richest and Guatemala is by the far the poorest but each of
these countries — and all in between - has been contributing in its own way to Haiti's recovery: Chile with
significant MINUSTAH forces, a portable hospital, supplies, and monetary pledge; Guatemala with food, a
rescue unit and a MINUSTAH pledge (and the fact that UN ASG Edmond Mulet is Guatemalan!). In the
context of the relief response, each country in the region has given, more or less, relative to their means.
Through this process of cooperation in Haiti's recovery, we as a region can collectively turn around Haiti's
history of isolation. This is a very significant historic moment and we need to run with it.
Sorry about the long email but wanted to share these thoughts — as one who has a particular relationship with
the island of Hispaniola. In this context, I want to share a 1994 Washington Post below which, although •
covering a different type of crisis, is demonstrative of how times have changed.

haiti history of isolation
The United States finds itself virtually alone struggling with the Haitian crisis.
A handful of tiny Caribbean nations have agreed to shelter a few thousand refugees. But not one
major political ally or trading partner in the Western Hemisphere has stepped up to help. In a joint
statement yesterday, three of six Central American countries said they might take in Haitians. The
other three said they would not.
Slippery promises are all that President Clinton gets when he seeks recruits for a peacekeeping
force; none seems willing to join an invasion to oust the military leaders who seized power in 1991.
Panama's president-elect, Ernesto Perez Balladares, explained the lack of support in a recent
interview: ""It is for the very simple reason that in Latin America Haiti is not recognized as a Latin
American country. Haitians speak a different language. They have different ethnic roots, a different
culture. They are very different altogether.""
Overwhelmingly black, speaking Creole French, practicing voodoo, a nation of liberated slaves long
locked in deep poverty, Haiti has a history ofisolation within the hemisphere. It doesn't fit with the big
countries of South America. It is not part of Central America. It has no real kinship with the other
island-nations of the Caribbean.
""Haitians are strangers even among the other black nations of the Caribbean,"" said Jocelyn McCalla,
executive director of the National Coalition for Haitian Refugees, a New York-based advocacy group.
Haitians are ""just as strange to someone from Grenada or Jamaica as they would be to someone
from Iowa or Montana.""

When Suriname agreed to take in 2,000 Haitian boat people, neighboring French Guiana announced
it would tighten border security in case any Haitians escaped.
In recent years, the Organization of American States (OAS) and the United Nations have worked to
compel elections in Haiti, to put sanctions on its military regime and to monitor human rights abuses.
Now, Clinton is asking for much more as he tries to create a network of refugee camps around the
region and to assemble multinational backing for the forcible removal of Haiti's military regime.
Finding partners for either sheltering refugees or invading would be a challenge no matter what
country was involved. Petitioning on behalf of Haiti makes it much harder.
""Unsympathetic perceptions of Haiti as a hopeless case work against the kind of cooperation that the
administration is seeking, and those perceptions are deeply ingrained,"" said Wayne Smith, a senior
fellow at the Center for International Policy.
Haiti's isolation goes back to its 1804 independence. ""Here was a nation born of a slave revolt. It
raised fears of another slave revolt in many other nations which then simply shunned Haiti for
decades to come,"" Smith said.
As the Spanish-speaking nations of South America gained independence in the 1820s, they excluded
Haiti from their designs for regional union. U.S. recognition did not come until 1862, when the Civil
War made it politically expedient.
Haiti's chronic poverty, its chaotic succession of despots and its conflicts with the Dominican Republic
have deepened its isolation.
Is racism a factor in the shunning of Haiti? Perhaps not: Black and mixed-race nations have
sometimes demonstrated biases against Haiti.
But allegations of racism have often beset U.S. policy toward Haiti and are a major factor in the
evolution of the current crisis.
The U.S. invasion of Haiti in 1915 produced a 19-year occupation that included the imposition of
racial segregation and the use of forced labor.

Randall Robinson, head of the TransAfrica lobbying organization, said, ""For almost 200 years U.S.
policies have treated Haiti differently than other nations with the painful consequences always visited
on Haitians who happen to be black.""
This history, Robinson said, combined with the fact that the slave revolt earned Haiti ""a place of pride
for people in the African diaspora,"" has made U.S. policy toward Haiti a logical target for U.S. blacks.
The activism has focused on what Robinson called ""the despicable practice of repatriation.""
Since 1991 the United States has tried to intercept Haitian boat people fleeing the military regime
before they could reach U.S. shores; most have been taken back to Haiti. No other nationality has
suffered that form of rejection.
As Robinson went into the 27th day of a hunger strike on May 8, Clinton announced he would end the
repatriation policy and begin more aggressive efforts to remove the Haitian military regime.
But Haiti's isolation has contributed to Clinton's setbacks trying to deal with the intertwined problems
of the generals and the refugees fleeing them.
On July 7, Panama backed out of an agreement to accept 10,000 Haitians, citing technicalities in the
Panama Canal Treaty. Balladares, who has promised to consider a more limited safe haven for
Haitians after he takes office Sept. 1, said the decision had nothing to do with the 1978 treaty and
everything to do with the way ordinary Panamanians view Haitians.
""People were very afraid of having the Haitians in the country and justifiably so,"" he said. ""They were
afraid of competing for scarce resources, afraid of people whose culture is different in many ways,
afraid of the AIDS problem. That is why the government backed out and everything else is excuses.""
Piero Gleijeses, a professor at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, said:
""Even if the Latin Americans felt some kinship to the Haitians, they would not be anxious to take in
refugees under these circumstances. They see the big, rich United States, a traditional nation of
resettlement, turning away the Haitians and they ask why they should have to take up the burden.""
Nearly all nations of the hemisphere have rallied around the idea of restoring democracy to Haiti, but
they are as reluctant to pursue that goal with force as they are to shelter Haitian refugees. Both
fundamental trends and the peculiarities of the Haitian case are at work.

Among Latin American governments the traditional distaste for U.S. military intervention has been
growing more explicit in recent years. For example, an OAS resolution censuring the United States
for the 1989 invasion of Panama marked the first time since the founding of the organization 42 years
earlier that it had formally criticized the United States.
In addition, the absence of a functioning political infrastructure and the prospects for lingering
violence in Haiti have made many Latin American countries leery of joining a peacekeeping force.
Chile, which in early July said it would support the restoration of democracy through a multinational
effort, has since insisted that it would offer ""technical assistance"" only after a democratic government
was operating in Haiti and could specifically request such help.
Summing up the attitudes across the region, Balladares said, ""Everyone just wishes that this problem
would go away.""

I was in three meetings today with Prime Minister Jean Max Bellerive and he made the following points:

Donors' Confab: The GOH would like to hold the donors' pledging conference in New York on April 15. They have
discounted their original date (March 22-23) because there is an IDB meeting in Mexico City on those same dates. There
is a technical donors' meetings in Santo Domingo on April 14, and the GOH would like the pledging session to come after
it. Bellerive said the GOH would also be open to doing the pledging session on March 31, though they prefer April 15.
Status of Forces Agreement: Bellerive asked me if we could propose to the GOH a SOFA covering US troops in Haiti. 1.4(D)
B1
I told him we would consult and get back to him ASAP.
Adoptions: Bellerive signed the two lists of humanitarian parole letters I brought him 1.4(B)
asking if we are close to finishing all the kids in the pipeline. In a later meeting with multiple donors Bellerive 1.4(D)
talked about the case of the ten Amcits being held for allegedly trying to take Haitian children out of the country withouB1
authorization. He said that this case is in the hands of the courts and that the Executive has no influence over the
outcome, but said it is an example of the GOH's need to control the problem of child trafficking which he said has
increased exponentially since the earthquake. He said the judge has three months to decide the case. He has already
dropped the most serious charge of kidnapping, and now the charges ""only carry a maximum of 15 years in prison."" He
said that the judge might determine that there isn't enough evidence in the case to try the Amcits. He said that the only
power the Executive has in the case would be a presidential pardon in the event they are found guilty. He would not
speculate on whether Preval would consider a pardon if the Amcits are found guilty.
Migrants: He approved the return to Haiti of 62 Haitian migrants detained on Great Exuma and said repatriations should
continue as pre-earthquake normal.
Relations with Dominican Republic: On instructions, I asked Bellerive in private what the GOH believed would be the
appropriate role of the Dominican Republic in donor coordination mechanisms.
Political dilemma: The executive decree establishing a state of urgency expires on February 15 and can only be
extended by Parliament. Parliament has been fiercely critical of the Preval/Bellerive government since the disaster, and
This leaves the
government with the dilemma of how to handle extraordinary disaster needs (such as declaring land of public utility)
after February 15. UN SRSG Mullet encouraged Bellerive to seek a ""full consensus"" with the opposition as ""nothing
short of unanimity"" would be required to address the enormous challenges Haiti is facing.
Bellerive told the donor community that the GOH may soon have to choose between
becoming totally ineffective (which he said they will not do) or taking actions that exceed the authority given to the

Executive by the law (which he implied they are prepared to do). The government is meeting with the private sector to
get their approval of their reconstruction strategy, recognizing that they will have great difficulty getting a consensus
with the political parties. Bellerive said that the GOH is also evaluating what to do about upcoming elections and
constitutional reform, but implied that they have more time to reach a decision on these matters. 1.4(B)

Preval to address the nation: The government is going to designate February 12 (the month anniversary of the quake) as
a day of national mourning and President Preval will make his first formal address to the nation since the disaster. They
are drafting his speech to be part mourning and part the vision of the future. Preval wants to announce that all the
ministries are up and running as usual.
Ministries: The PM said that the Primature and the Ministry of Planning will be moving into the old US Embassy building.
The courts will move into the old USAID building. The plan to move a number of the ministries out to Croix des
Bouquets has met with very little enthusiasm from the main line ministries. They prefer to clear the rubble off of their
properties in downtown Port-au-Prince and either build new buildings (EU is offering to finance) or put up temporary
structures (Canada is offering to finance).

The Security Council deeply regrets the loss of life and injuries resulting from the use of force during the Israeli military
operation in international waters against the convoy sailing to Gaza. The Council, in this context, condemns those acts
which resulted in the loss of at least ten civilians and many wounded, and expresses its condolences to their
families. The Security Council requests the immediate release of the ships as well as the civilians held by Israel. The
Council urges Israel to permit full consular access, to allow the countries concerned to retrieve their deceased and
wounded immediately, and to ensure the delivery of humanitarian assistance from the convoy to its destination. The
Security Council takes note of the statement of the UN Secretary—General on the need to have a full investigation into
the matter and it calls for a prompt, impartial, credible and transparent investigation conforming to international
standards. The Security Council stresses that the situation in Gaza is not sustainable. The Council re-emphasizes the
importance of the full implementation of Resolutions 1850 and 1860. In that context, it reiterates its grave concern at
the humanitarian situation in Gaza and stresses the need for sustained and regular flow of goods and people to Gaza as
well as unimpeded provision and distribution of humanitarian assistance throughout Gaza. The Security Council

SECURITY COUNCIL PRESIDENTIAL STATEMENT ON THE RECENT INCIDENT IN THE EASTERN MEDITERRANEAN
The Security Council deeply regrets the loss of life and injuries resulting from the use of force during the Israeli military
operation in international waters against the convoy sailing to Gaza. The Council, in this context, condemns those acts
which resulted in the loss of at least ten civilians and many wounded, and expresses its condolences to their
families. The Security Council requests the immediate release of the ships as well as the civilians held by Israel. The
Council urges Israel to permit full consular access, to allow the countries concerned to retrieve their deceased and
wounded immediately, and to ensure the delivery of humanitarian assistance from the convoy to its destination. The
Security Council takes note of the statement of the UN Secretary—General on the need to have a full investigation into
the matter and it calls for a prompt, impartial, credible and transparent investigation conforming to international
standards. The Security Council stresses that the situation in Gaza is not sustainable. The Council re-emphasizes the
importance of the full implementation of Resolutions 1850 and 1860. In that context, it reiterates its grave concern at
the humanitarian situation in Gaza and stresses the need for sustained and regular flow of goods and people to Gaza as
well as unimpeded provision and distribution of humanitarian assistance throughout Gaza. The Security Council
underscores that the only viable solution to Israeli-Palestinian conflict is an agreement negotiated between the parties
and re-emphasizes that only a two-State solution, with an independent and viable Palestinian State living side by side in
peace and security with Israel and its other neighbours, could bring peace to the region. The Security Council expresses
support for the proximity talks and voices concern that this incident took place while the proximity talks are underway
and urges the parties to act with restraint, avoiding any unilateral and provocative actions, and all international partners
to promote an atmosphere of cooperation between the parties and throughout the region.

LONDON (AP) - President Barack Obama's planned nuclear summit in Washington next week will go on without Britain's
leader. British Prime Minister Gordon Brown has told Obama he'll be staying in London to concentrate on a hotly
contested May election. Brown told Obama in a phone call that he will send Foreign Secretary David Miliband to
represent Britain at the April 12-13 meeting. Obama is hosting dozens of world leaders to discuss the spread of atomic
weapons and the threat of nuclear terrorism. Brown's Labour Party is seeking a fourth term in office but the opposition
Conservatives are ahead in the polls and favored to take power for the first time since 1997.

Subject: (Reuters) Kyrgyzstan asks Russia to help quell ethnic clashes
OSH - Kyrgyzstan appealed for Russian help to stop ethnic fighting that has killed at least 62 and left parts of its second-
largest city in flames, the worst violence since the president was toppled in April. The interim government in
Kyrgyzstan, which hosts U.S. and Russian military bases, said it was powerless to stop armed gangs from burning down
the homes and businesses of ethnic Uzbeks in parts of Osh. Gun battles raged throughout the night.
""We need the entry of outside armed forces to calm the situation down,"" interim government leader Roza Otunbayeva
told reporters. ""We have appealed to Russia for help and I have already signed such a letter for President Dmitry
Medvedev.""
Russian PM Putin and Otunbayeva discussed the situation in a telephone call on June 12, the Russian government's press
service said, without giving details.
A Reuters correspondent in Osh said gun battles had taken place through the night in an Uzbek neighbourhood. Gas was
shut off to Osh and some neighborhoods have no electricity. ""Entire streets are on fire,"" Interior Ministry spokesman
Rakhmatillo Akhmedov said. ""The situation is very bad. There is no sign of it stopping. Homes have been set ablaze.""
Otunbayeva said Osh was also facing a humanitarian crisis as food was running out. She said her government had
decided to open the border to Uzbekistan to allow fleeing Uzbeks to escape, although it was not clear who controlled
the frontier. One witness said some women and children had made it across to the Uzbek town of Marhamat, 638 miles
from Osh, and camps had been set up for those without family in Uzbekistan. A spokeswoman for the Kyrgyz Health
Ministry said at least 62 people had been killed and 790 wounded in the violence, which is taking place in the southerly
power base of former president Kurmanbek Bakiyev, deposed in April by a popular revolt.
""Everywhere is burning: Uzbek homes, restaurants and cafes. The whole town is covered in smoke,"" local human rights
worker Dilmurad Ishanov, an ethnic Uzbek, said by telephone from Osh. ""We don't need the Kyrgyz authorities. We
need Russia. We need troops. We need help.""

Marshall Fund (Ron Asmus), and Ambassador Holbrooke has attended every year. His presence
this year consists of two things: 1) bilat meetings including those with EU High Rep
Catherine Ashton, Codel Casey, Nato Sec Gen Rasmussen, Ambassador Daalder, and Ambassador
Kennard (some with Mullen); and 2) an internationally televised BBC discussion on Afghanistan
and Pakistan with Admiral Mullen. The panel will be shown live and broadcast on BBC World
four times over the course of the weekend - a great communications opportunity. Fawzia Koofi,
who is the Deputy Speaker of the Afghan parliament and Former Dutch Development Minister Bert

Today, the Haitian judge released eight of the ten American citizens and they have departed Haiti for the United
States. Two members of the group are being detained in Haiti to answer further questions, as the investigation is
ongoing. The United State Government respects the sovereign right of the Government of Haiti to conduct its
own judicial processes. The United States Embassy in Port au Prince has been providing the detained
Americans with consular visits and assistance to ensure that they are safe and receiving necessary care. Haitian
authorities have been cooperative in ensuring the individuals' safety and welfare since their arrest and we have
every expectation this will continue.

Dear Cheryl —
In my last email (Friday, 5/28), I attached the letter from the bipartisan Co-Chairs and Executive Committee members of
the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission sent to Assistant Secretary Mike Posner expressing grave concern about the
recent rise in death threats, attacks and murders of Colombian human rights defenders, religious, community and other
NGO leaders. Congressman McGovern also strongly encouraged the Secretary to meet with representatives of those
organizations and individuals being threatened, with a particularly effort to reach out to and invite the Bishops of
Tumaco (Naritio), Barrancabermeja/Medio Magdalena (Santander), and we would now add Putumayo, since the
Colombian Catholic Church just advised us yesterday of increased death threats against religious workers there. In
addition, we recommended inviting Monserior Hector Fabio Henao, director of Pastoral Social, at the Archdiocese in

Bogota, who represents all the pastoral work of the Church throughout the country, as well as representatives from the
Mennonite and Lutheran churches, in particular.
While in Colombia, the most important thing the Secretary can do is avoid effusive praise for President Alvaro Uribe,
who leaves office in August. Inside Colombia, the visit by the Secretary is being described as focusing solely on the free
trade agreement and continuing support of the counterdrug strategy/Plan Colombia. Without changes in the human
rights situation and the culture of impunity, it is unlikely that anything the Secretary might say or do will alter the
equation on Capitol Hill regarding the trade agreement. It should be noted that the October 2008 GAO report on the
counter-drug operations in Colombia concluded that U.S. assistance was successful in increasing security in parts of the
country, but a failure in the areas of counter-narcotics (GAO-09-71) , and a subsequent April 2009 USAID evaluation on
U.S. aid for Plan Colombia for illegal crop reduction and Colombian counternarcotics policies actually contribute to
increased coca production.
The Colombian president has been a solid backer of U.S. policy and U.S. interests in the region, and has achieved some
important improvements in the country's security situation. It is important to recognize that, but to do so without
repeating the tone of Defense Secretary Gates' April visit, in which he called Uribe a ""great hero""
<http://www.defense.gov/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=58754> and failed even to mention any concerns.
These concerns are of critical importance, and while the Secretary need not list them all, at least some deserve public
acknowledgement — some recognition that it is important to the United States that Colombia, including the current
government and its successor, show the necessary political will to deal with them:
• A sharp rise in alleged military killings of civilians. In many cases, these are so-called ""false positives"": non-
combatants murdered and later presented as members of armed groups killed in combat. These, notes
<http://www.extrajudicialexecutions.org/colombia> UN Special Rapporter for Extrajudicial Executions Philip Alston,
""began occurring with a disturbing frequency across Colombia from 2004."" Citing prosecutors' and NGOs' reports, Alston
indicates that Colombia's security forces may have killed 1,486 civilians during the first six years of Alvaro Uribe's
presidency. Alston notes that the Defense Ministry only began to address the situation after the media broke the story
of the false-positives and the subsequent negative publicity and horrified public outcry.
The prosecution of ""false positives"" is moving with excruciating slowness. In perhaps the most notorious case — the
murders of about twenty young men from the poor Bogota suburb of Soacha — nearly all of the accused soldiers and
officers have been released from prison <http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=49968>, pending trial, as
deadlines for timely prosecution have run out. Since their arrest in late 2008, their case has been prolonged by
numerous delaying tactics by the defense, including attempts to have their cases tried in the military court system as
""acts of service."" Alston reports that the impunity rate on these extrajudicial murders by security forces may be as high
as 98.5 percent.
Mounting allegations that the President's intelligence service, the DAS, was put at the service
<http://www.cipcol.org/?p=1123> of paramilitary leaders and narcotraffickers; used to spy on and intimidate
<http://www.cipcol.org/?p=752> Supreme Court justices, opposition politicians, journalists and human rights
defenders; and employed in a campaign of sabotage and smears <http://www.cipcoLorg/?p=1467> against political
opponents.
Prosecutors are alleging that the orders to have the DAS carry out wiretaps, surveillance and ""political warfare"" came
from high up in the Colombian presidency <http://www.caracoltv.com/noticias/justicia/articulo168592-tres-asesores-
de-uribe-son-investigados-chuzadas-ilegales> , though the question of ""what President Uribe knew, and when he knew
it"" remains unanswered. Meanwhile efforts to reform or dissolve the DAS are stalled in Colombia's Congress.
President Uribe's political coalition has also been hit by a scandal known in Colombia as ""para-politics."" This
coalition has included dozens of political bosses from regions beyond the capital. Many are large landholders with ties to
narcotrafficking, the same local leaders who created and fostered the brutal pro-government paramilitary groups that
killed tens of thousands of non-combatants in the 1990s and early 2000s.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05769736 Date: 08/31/2015
Evidence, much of it from former paramilitary leaders, has brought about 300 criminal investigations against legislators,
governors, mayors and other local officials, nearly all of them Alvaro Uribe's political supporters, who made common
cause with the far-right warlords. To date, of the 278 congresspeople and senators elected in 2006, 68
<http://www.nuevoarcoiris.org.co/sac/?q=node/64> are under official investigation, on trial, or convicted for
paramilitary ties. Those embroiled in parapolitics include the President's cousin, Mario Uribe; the brother of his former
foreign minister; and individuals whom the President had named to be Colombia's ambassadors to Chile, the Dominican
Republic, and Canada.
The Colombian prosecutors, investigators, witnesses and non-governmental organizations trying to uncover the truth
about these abuses are working under conditions of great personal risk. They, too, are heroes and would benefit greatly
from a public expression of concern about the cases they are investigating, and a reminder that their work is legitimate
and important to U.S. interests in Colombia.
At the same time, it is important to avoid appearing to endorse any candidate in the June 20 runoff elections. Between
the first and second rounds of a country's presidential election is a politically awkward time for a high-level official visit.
Though President Uribe's former defense minister, Juan Manuel Santos, is the overwhelming favorite given his margin of
success in the May 30th first round of balloting over former Bogota mayor Antanas Mockus, it is necessary at this stage
to convey a sense of balance and a willingness to work closely with whoever wins. As a result, any kind words for one
candidate should be balanced by praise for the other.
Finally, it would be helpful to remind the Colombian people that the United States supports a peaceful resolution of
Bogota's worsening differences with Venezuela. While President Chavez's behavior is a significant concern, it would be
most unhelpful to be perceived on this trip as fanning the flames of conflict with Colombia — or playing into the Chavez
rhetoric that the U.S. and Colombia have military aspirations in the region.
Hope this memo, along with last week's copy of the TLHRC letter to Assistant Secretary Posner, are helpful and useful
materials for the Secretary as she plans her trip.
Very best wishes —
On behalf of Cong. Jim McGovern

Trafficking fears as Haiti children go missing

The UN has warned countries not to step up adoptions from Haiti in the wake of the disaster. (AFP: Matthew Marek
United Nations officials say children have gone missing from hospitals in Haiti since the devastating January 12
earthquake, raising fears of trafficking for adoption abroad.
""We have documented around 15 cases of children disappearing from hospitals and not with their own family at the
time,"" said UNICEF adviser Jean Luc Legrand.

""UNICEF has been working in Haiti for many years and we knew the problem with the trade of children in Haiti that
existed already beforehand.
""Unfortunately, many of these trade networks have links with the international adoption market.""
The agency said it had warned countries during the past week not to step up adoptions from Haiti in the immediate
wake of the quake.
However several are fast-tracking adoption procedures already under way, including Belgium, Canada, France, Germany,
the Netherlands, Spain and the United States.
Mr Legrand said the situation was similar to the aftermath of the tsunami in Asia five years ago.
Trafficking networks were springing into action immediately after the disaster and taking advantage of the weakness of
local authorities and relief coordination ""to kidnap children and get them out of the country"".
Rupert Colville, a spokesman for the office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, said child enslavement and
trafficking in Haiti was ""an existing problem and could easily emerge as a serious issue over the coming weeks and
months"".
The UN mission in Haiti has stepped up surveillance of roads, UNICEF officials said.
Mr Legrand said there was separate but only anecdotal evidence of people taking children by road to the neighbouring
Dominican Republic and loading children on to planes.
""We have seen over the past years many children being taken out of the country without any legal procedure,"" he said.
""This is going on. This is happening now. We are starting to have the first evidence of that, this is unquestionable.""
He was unable to give details on the 15 missing children or their condition or clearly connect the anecdotal observations
in Haiti's chaos with trafficking.
The cases were documented by social workers and by partner non-governmental organisations working for UNICEF in
hospitals.

Bay Area execs seek to open doors with Syria
Andrew S. Ross
Sunday, June 20, 2010
Call it a dual purpose mission, with pretty high stakes.
Bay Area executives fromCisco Systems Inc.,Symantec Corp. andVeriSign Inc. returned Friday
from a trip to Syria, where they were tasked by the Obama administration with helping open business
and diplomatic doors to a member of what used to be called the ""axis of evil.""
Were the doors flung open to a country with whom U.S. businesses are still mostly forbidden to trade?
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05769938 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05769938 Date: 08/31/2015
Not exactly, given that Internet freedom, transparency, the elimination of corruption and a general
opening up, Syrian leaders were told, are among the sine qua non for getting them what they say they
want - U.S. businesses and investment there.
""Candid"" was a word used by one delegation member to describe the four days of talks last week in
Damascus and Aleppo, a commercial center and Syria's largest city. ""They provided a lot of clarity for
both sides. On our side, how receptive the Syrians are to U.S. companies doing business there, and for
the Syrians, what they need to do to get things going,"" said the delegation member, who agreed to
speak only on background.
The delegation, which also included senior executives fromMicrosoft Corp. andDell Inc., was led
byAlec Ross, Secretary of StateHillary Rodham Clinton's senior adviser for innovation,
andJared Cohen, a member of Clinton's policy planning staff.
There were sit-downs with Syrian PresidentBashar Assadand other government ministers and
meetings with business leaders, including those in the country's nascent high-tech sector, along with
students, academics and leaders of civic and social organizations.
Laying down the conditions:Unlike most U.S. companies, Cisco, Symantec and the other high-
tech firms on the trip are allowed to do business in Syria under a waiver granted, under certain
conditions, to U.S. information technology companies.
According to Syria's state news agency, Sana, ""the American executives discussed setting up
authorized centers for (their) companies in Syria.""
But in meeting after meeting, according to the delegate, the executives said there were too many
barriers to entry, including Internet access, which Clinton has said is a key plank of U.S. foreign
policy.
""They can't do business in a place that is not open,"" was the message, according to the delegate.
(While Syria remains a member in good standing of the axis of authoritarians, some of the same
concerns could be raised about countries these companies do conduct business with - like, dare we
say, China).
The Syrian government said it was considering a law that would require that the blocking of Web sites
- a common, often arbitrary and unpredictable happening there - be at least subject to judicial review.
""Now, we have to wait and see what the government does,"" the delegate said.
In an earlier statement about the trip, Symantec said it was also designed to help the Obama
administration's ""effort to continue strengthening diplomatic relations throughout the Middle East.""
That also remains to be seen.

It's not the first time the administration, responding to come-hither hints from Damascus, has, like
Charlie Brown, teed up the football, only to have it snatched away, Lucy-style, as Syria got cold and
persisted in allying itself with U.S. archenemy Iran.
Obama, announcing the renewal of sanctions on Syria last month, cited the country's ""continuing
support for terrorist organizations and pursuit of weapons of mass destruction and missile programs,
(which) continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy
and economy of the United States.""
Opportunities in the sand:Meanwhile,Robert Ludden, chief operating officer of San
Francisco'sKMD Architects, is back in the Middle East seeking more business, particularly in
Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Saudi Arabia.
Recently Ludden nailed down the firm's first prime contract there, as designer of the $15 million
Imperial College of London diabetes center in Abu Dhabi, a showpiece facility for a disease that is
surprisingly prevalent in the region.
He sees the Middle East as a growing market for architects and designers, as a number of countries
there, especially the desert kingdoms, are seeking to develop sustainable communities.
""Saudi Arabia is the next big one,"" Ludden says.
Going global:TheBay Area Councilofficially opened its first ""overseas global office"" on Friday, in
Shanghai.
The office, located in Shanghai's Knowledge and Innovation Community, is meant to serve as a
gateway service for Bay Area companies looking to set up in China, as well as ""guiding Chinese
companies and investment to the Bay Area.""
Next up for a global office, the council says: India.

Northern Ireland agrees power-sharing deal
Gordon Brown hails historic deal which will see justice and policing powers be devolved to Stormont from 12 April

Justice and policing powers will be devolved to Northern Ireland <http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/northernireland> 's
power-sharing government from 12 April in a historic deal agreed by the main parties that ""opens a new chapter"" after
decades of violence, Gordon Brown said today.
Standing alongside his Irish counterpart, Brian Cowen, at a press conference at Hillsborough Castle outside Belfast, the
prime minister said the ""inspirational"" agreement between Sinn Fein <http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/sinn-fein>
and the Democratic Unionist party (DUP) <http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/dup> was a foundation for lasting peace.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05767374 Date: 08/31/2015
The deal —finally agreed to by the DUP <http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2010/feb/05/northern-ireland-dup-ulster-
deal> last night and described as a final piece in the jigsaw after a long search for peace — comes after two weeks of
round-the-clock negotiations and brings an end to fears that the power-sharing government might collapse.
It will see policing and justice powers devolved from Westminster to the assembly within weeks and includes new plans
on overseeing parades.
Brown, who travelled to Belfast this morning, said the agreement had been possible because of ""a new spirit of mutual
co-operation and respect"".
The deal meets a key Sinn Fein demand and prevents the republican party from walking out of the power-sharing
executive. In return, the DUP has secured reforms to the way loyalist marches are handled in Northern Ireland, including
the abolition of the Parades Commission, a body most unionists regard as biased in favour of nationalists.
A cross-community vote will now be held in the Stormont assembly on 9 March before the policing and justice powers
are devolved from London on 12 April.
Brown told reporters: ""The achievements have been as great as they are inspirational. This moment and this agreement
belongs to the people of Northern Ireland, all of the people, and now more than ever before so does their future ... This
is the last chapter of a long and troubled story and the beginning of a new chapter after decades of violence, years of
talks, weeks of stalemate.""
Cowen praised both unionists and nationalists for making ""fair and balanced compromises"" to bridge the divisions and
said the quality of the negotiations meant that the ""devolved institutions can and will work"".
The Northern Ireland secretary, Shaun Woodward, said the deal would further isolate republican dissidents who have
launched three separate gun and bomb attacks against police stations in the province over the last 10 days. The deal
would ""absolutely"" make Northern Ireland a safer place, he said.
The DUP leader, Peter Robinson, said the agreement ""will be more enduring because of the time spent"" in forming it.
Referring back to the Belfast Agreement of 1998 <http://www.nio.gov.uk/the-agreement> when negotiations bore fruit
at the 11th hour, the Sinn Fein president, Gerry Adams, described the current deal and the rescue of power-sharing as
""yet another very good Friday"".
Jeffrey Donaldson told the Guardian the DUP's 36-strong assembly team was now unanimously in favour of the deal.
But the Ulster Unionist party (UUP) has yet to officially back the package which will allow the assembly to set up
legislation to change the way parades are judged.
A UUP spokeswoman said members wanted to see the proposed agreement before giving their response to the two
governments. ""We have not had sight of this agreement and until we do we will not be signing up to it,"" she said.
The talks, which centred on Hillsborough Castle, outside Belfast, are the longest set of continuous negotiations held in
the near 20-year peace process. Sinn Fein had accused the DUP of stalling on the transfer of policing powers for the last
three years and it was feared that failure to find agreement could see the collapse of the power-sharing government led
by the two parties.
The agreement finally came near midnight at Stormont's parliament building. Earlier in the evening Sinn Fein had said
the basis of a deal was on the table and it was giving the DUP leadership the time to persuade its party to accept it.
Robinson emerged from a meeting of party colleagues to confirm that he had secured unanimous support for the
proposals. Earlier in the week up to 14 DUP assembly members had opposed a proposed deal because it did not give
unionists enough concessions.
Robinson said he would now look to gain the support of the community and the smaller assembly parties for the deal.
""We have a basis upon which we can go forward and recommend it [the deal] to our party, to the other parties in
Northern Ireland and to the community.
""An essential element of the Democratic Unionist Party's manifesto is the requirement for community confidence; we
believe this can be the basis for gaining that confidence.""
However the leader of the hardline Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV), Jim Allister, questioned why the 14 DUP rebels had
changed their minds.
""The deal hasn't changed, only the snowmen of the DUP, who melted once the heat came on,"" Allister said.
The DUP now faces a struggle to ward off the TUV threat in the forthcoming general election. Allister will portray the
deal as a sell-out of unionist principles and a sop to republicanism.

FISA director leaves legacy of collaboration
Breaking down barriers
Wednesday, May 26, 2010
By Tina Calabro, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette
Pam Panchak/Post-Gazette
FISA Foundation retiring executive director Dee Delaney, left, with the new executive director, Kristy Trautmann.
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05769604 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05769604 Date: 08/31/2015
To people in the local disability community, Dee Delaney is a household name.
When news came this spring of her intention to retire as executive director of FISA Foundation in August, one could
almost hear a collective gasp. With 14 years at the helm of the small but influential foundation, Ms. Delaney has had a
pronounced and lasting influence on quality of life in our region.
On behalf of FISA, Ms. Delaney has changed the local landscape not only by funding projects with far-reaching results,
but by bringing people together to craft solutions to longstanding problems and by becoming personally involved in
many of the projects the foundation funds.
She became the first executive director of FISA Foundation when it began in 1996 with proceeds from the sale of
Harmarville Rehabilitation Center, a nonprofit, to HealthSouth, a for-profit organization.
The new foundation would continue the mission of the Federation of Independent School Alumnae, an organization that
opened a convalescent home for women in 1911 and the Harmarville Rehabilitation Center in 1954. That mission was to
improve the lives of women, girls and people with disabilities in Western Pennsylvania.
Ms. Delaney, who had been involved with Harmarville since 1980 -- starting as a volunteer and ending as development
director of its foundation -- sought the job of leading FISA. ""I realized the impact the foundation could have. FISA is not a
large foundation, but it's a very focused foundation,"" she said.
Over the past 14 years, FISA's endowment has grown to more than $38 million. Over $17 million has been granted to
726 projects in 298 organizations.
A roll call of projects funded by FISA reflects progressive thinking about including of people with disabilities in all aspects
of life, especially access to health care. Programs have become national models.
Women with disabilities, for example, often encounter barriers in typical healthcare settings. Standard exam tables and
diagnostic equipment were designed for the able-bodied, and medical staff often struggle to accommodate individuals
with special needs. FISA provided the seed money for the Center for Women with Disabilities at Magee-Womens
Hospital of UPMC, one of the first such clinics in the nation. FISA is involved in the overall issue of improving access to
healthcare for people with disabilities.
Likewise, people with disabilities have difficulty obtaining dental care. A FISA-funded project at Achieva is creating
statewide, systemic solutions. FISA also provided support for the Center for Patients with Special Needs at Pitt's School
of Dental Medicine.
FISA has also taken the lead on training arts and cultural venues how to make events more accessible and helping places
of worship more welcoming.
""Dee is a national leader in the field. If there were more people like her, we wouldn't have the issues we have,"" said Kim
Hutchinson, executive director of the Disability Funders Network, based in Virginia. Ms. Delaney has been a board officer
for the group since 2004.
Nancy Murray, president of the ARC of Greater Pittsburgh, said the issues Ms. Delaney has helped solve are ones that
people have been working on for years.
""People talk about strategies, but never move forward to solutions. Dee brings all the stakeholders together to get to
the solutions,"" said Ms. Murray.
""I think Dee has greatly influenced the next generation of nonprofit and philanthropic leaders, leading by example on
the value of true collaboration,"" said Susie Chase, a board member of FISA and former executive director of Working
Order, a FISA grantee.

""With Dee, it is never about her own role, or FISA's role, it is always about unmet needs in the community and the work
that needs to be done. That seems to bring out the best in every partner, and in everyone who has the privilege of
working with her.""
Ms. Chase added that advice and technical assistance Ms. Delaney provided to Working Order ""were of equal or greater
value to the organization than the grant funds.""
""I still, after many years, never come away from a meeting with Dee that I haven't learned something, been inspired to
work harder, and understood more clearly the value of someone else's ideas and efforts.""
In her retirement, Ms. Delaney plans to ""give back to the community in new ways,"" she said. A new frontier is helping
young people with disabilities prepare for employment and leadership. ""We have to keep the fire burning.""
On May 19, FISA announced that Kristy Trautmann, who has served as the foundation's program director for six years,
was promoted to executive director.
""We sought a person who would follow Ms. Delaney's visionary leadership and guide the foundation into the next
decade,"" said Jane Burger, who chaired the search. committee. ""We know that we have found such a person in Kristy
Trautmann. She understands the challenges facing the populations the foundation supports and has the trust of the
board and the community.""

Obama's diplomacy, not fully engaged
By Jackson Diehl
Monday,'May 3, 2010; A15
Barack Obama's foreign policy has been defined so far by his attempts to ""engage"" with adversaries or rivals of
the United States, such as Ayatollah Ali Khamenei of Iran and Dmitry Medvedev of Russia. The results have
been mixed. But now the president's focus is visibly shifting. In the next 18 months, Obama's record abroad will
be made or broken by his ability to do business with two nominal U.S. allies: Hamid Karzai and Binyamin
Netanyahu.
Karzai has become the hardest problem in Obama's Afghanistan surge, one that might be summed up as ""can't
win with him, can't win without him."" Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu holds the key to whether Israel will be
prepared to accept a Palestinian state within the two-year time frame Obama has established -- and also,
perhaps, whether Iran's pursuit of nuclear weapons will lead to war.
Both men are prickly and somewhat inscrutable. Both know their countries and their own careers depend on
support from the United States, but both are also resistant to key elements of Obama's policies. Handling them
well requires skillful and subtle diplomacy by the U.S. president and by those who carry out his policies.
And Obama has not done well. In fact, his treatment of the Israeli and Afghan leaders during one week in late
March -- immediately after his victory on health care -- marked a low point of his performance as president.
First, Obama seized on an errant Israeli announcement about housing construction in East Jerusalem to reopen a
pointless battle with Netanyahu. During a disastrous March 23 meeting at the White House, Obama demanded -
- in vain -- that Israel stop all building in Jerusalem, and at one point he left Netanyahu and his delegation to
stew in the Roosevelt room while he retired to the second-floor residence for dinner.
Five days later, Obama flew to Kabul for another cold meeting, this time with Karzai. In a briefing for reporters
on the plane, national security adviser James Jones made it clear that Obama was displeased with Karzai's lack
of progress since beginning a new term as president last fall. In case there was any doubt, Obama spelled out

Was it hubris from health care that brought on this burst of presidential imperialism? Whatever the cause, the
results were disastrous. Netanyahu retreated to Jerusalem, where, after a couple of weeks of sulking, he
defiantly announced that settlement construction in Jerusalem would continue. Karzai summoned Iranian
President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to Kabul, then delivered a tirade against Western interference that concluded
with a threat to join the Taliban.
The administration has spent the past month cleaning up this mess. Obama abruptly changed his approach,
sending a note to Karzai in early April thanking him for the Kabul visit and confirming his invitation to visit
Washington in May -- a trip that, just days earlier, the White House had hinted at canceling. Meanwhile, the
president and a good part of his Cabinet have been heaping love on Israel -- if not precisely Netanyahu -- by
proclaiming their commitment to the relationship in speech after speech before pro-Israel groups.
The result is that the administration now has a detailed plan for working with Karzai over the next several
months. Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, which have been delayed for two months by the flap over Jerusalem,
might finally begin this week. Quiet diplomacy by the administration's special envoys in the Middle East and
Afghanistan, George Mitchell and Richard Holbrooke, has achieved what presidential lectures did not.
The underlying problems, however, haven't changed. Karzai still has little appetite for attacking the corruption
in his government or rallying support for U.S. military campaigns against the Taliban. Netanyahu remains
wedded to a right-wing coalition that would not allow him to make significant concessions in peace
negotiations, even if he wanted to.
Obama has to find a way to coax each of them toward a change of course. Public bullying won't do it.
Assurances of U.S. support and stroking by special envoys go only so far. What's missing is personal chemistry
and confidence, the construction of a bond between leaders that can persuade a U.S. ally to take a risk; in other
words, presidential ""engagement."" Isn't that what Obama promised?

background and a few suggested points we didn't have time to clear it with anyone, but I thought better something
than nothing. Scot
Background:
Representative Loretta Sanchez asked yesterday to speak with you regarding her concerns that the Administration is
moving too fast in the direction of providing economic benefits to Vietnam -- for example, granting access to the
General System of Preferences (GSP), permitting participation in the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) as an associate
member -- even as the human rights situation deteriorates. Sanchez may try to button-hole you at your Internet speech
today.

call.* Sounds like your discussion with Lavrov did the trick:
The Quartet re-affirms that the current situation in Gaza, including the humanitarian and human rights situation of the
civilian population, is unsustainable, unacceptable, and not in the interests of any of those concerned. The Quartet
reiterates its call for a solution that addresses Israel's legitimate security concerns, including an end to weapons
smuggling into Gaza; promotes Palestinian unity based on the Palestine Liberation Organization commitments and the
reunification of Gaza and the West Bank under the legitimate Palestinian Authority; and ensures the unimpeded flow of
humanitarian aid, commercial goods and persons to and from Gaza, consistent with United Nations Security Council
resolution 1860 (2009). The Quartet declares its readiness to work closely with Israel, the Palestinian Government and
international donors in order to achieve sustainable economic development on the basis of the full implementation of
the Agreement on Access and Movement of 2005 and in the broader perspective of the two-state solution.
Consistent with these objectives, the Quartet and the Quartet Representative have worked with Israel, as well as
consulting the Palestinian Authority, Egypt, and other concerned parties, to effect a fundamental change in policy in
Gaza. The new policy towards Gaza just announced by the Government of Israel is a welcome development. The Quartet
notes that the elaboration of further details and modalities of implementation will be important in ensuring the
effectiveness of the new policy. Full and effective implementation will comprise a significant shift in strategy towards
meeting the needs of Gaza's population for humanitarian and commercial goods, civilian reconstruction and
infrastructure, and legitimate economic activity as well as the security needs of Israel. The Quartet will continue to work
with Israel, the Palestinian Authority, and other concerned parties to ensure these arrangements are implemented as
quickly as possible. The Quartet affirms that much work remains to achieve fully the solution stated above, and, in
consultation with the concerned parties, it will monitor closely the implementation of the policy in all its aspects. It will
actively explore additional ways to improve the situation in Gaza, encourage involvement of the PA at the crossings and
promote greater commerce between the West Bank and Gaza.
The Quartet stresses the importance of United Nations and other international interventions, as well as the work of local
non-governmental organizations, to be expanded in Gaza to meet urgent civilian needs, and calls on all parties to fully
enable this work.
The Quartet recognizes that Israel has legitimate security concerns that must continue to be safeguarded, and believes
efforts to maintain security while enabling movement and access for Palestinian people and goods are critical. The
Quartet commits to work with Israel and the international community to prevent the illicit trafficking of arms and
ammunition into Gaza. It urges all those wishing to deliver goods to do so through established channels so that their
cargo can be inspected and transferred via land crossings into Gaza. The Quartet emphasizes that there is no need for
unnecessary confrontations and calls on all parties to act responsibly in meeting the needs of the people of Gaza.
The Quartet also calls for an end to the deplorable detention of Gilad Shalit in advance of the fourth anniversary of his
capture on June 25; it further condemns the violation of Hamas' international obligation to provide him access by the
International Committee of the Red Cross and demands that Hamas immediately remedy the situation.
The Quartet also reiterates its support for proximity talks toward the resumption, without pre-conditions, of direct
bilateral negotiations that resolve all final status issues as previously agreed by the parties. The Quartet believes these
negotiations should lead to a settlement, negotiated between the parties within 24 months, that ends the occupation
which began in 1967 and results in the emergence of an independent, democratic, and viable Palestinian state in the
West Bank and Gaza, living side by side in peace and security with Israel and its other neighbours.","UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05769116 Date: 08/31/2015

(AP) Updated at 1:29 p.m. ET
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin played the eco-warrior in Russia's Arctic on Thursday, helping scientists track endangered
polar bears and calling for a cleanup of the region.
Putin traveled to Franz Josef Land, an archipelago in the Arctic Ocean off the northwest coast of Russia's mainland in his
latest display of adventuring prowess to highlight the country's guardianship of the resource-rich region.
Wearing a bright red coat and cap, the 57-year-old premier kneeled at the head of a tranquilized polar bear to attach a
satellite-tracking collar, then helped elevate the beast for weighing. The images were broadcast nationally.
Putin helped measure the bear and roll it onto its side.

On his departure, he shook its paw and uttered the words: ""Be well.""
""The paw is heavy. This is the master of the Arctic, you can feel that straight away,"" Putin said.
Of a total 25,000 polar bears remaining in the wild, about 6,000 are in Russia's Arctic territory, Russian news agencies
quoted officials as saying.
Putin also called for ""a general cleanup of the Arctic,"" ordering the removal of thousands of barrels of fuel buried in the
snow that had been left unused by a Soviet-era military base.
He has been spearheading Russia's re-emergence as a regional power, including the country's claims over the Arctic's
formidable natural resources. Some 90 billion barrels of oil and one-third of the world's undiscovered natural gas lie
hidden in the Arctic region, the U.S. Geological Survey estimates.
""Geopolitically, Russia's deepest interests are linked to the Arctic,"" Putin said. ""Here Russia's security and defense
capabilities is provided for. Here there are vitally important transport communications.""
Canada, the U.S., Russia and Denmark have competing claims before a United Nations commission regarding extend
their undersea boundaries into areas previously blocked by Arctic ice.
Moscow dramatically staked its claim to the region by dropping a flag on the ocean floor at the North Pole in 2007.
Since then, all four countries have agreed to cool their rhetoric and allow scientists to finish their surveys.
Putin adores the media spotlight when it accentuates his macho side. He has been photographed fishing bare-chested in
Russia's Altai region, and was shown on television diving into an icy river and swimming the butterfly stroke.
He has also tackled predators in the wild before, shooting a tiger with a tranquilizer gun and releasing leopards.

Republican dissidents suspected after blast outside courthouse in Newry as evacuation was taking place
• Buzz up!

• Mark Tran
• quardian.co.uk, Tuesday 23 February 2010
• Article history
A car bomb exploded last night outside the courthouse in Newry, Northern Ireland, police said. There were no initial
reports of any injuries in the blast.
Police said the vehicle was abandoned at the front of the building in the Co Down town at around lOpm. Officers were in
the process of evacuating the area when the car exploded.
Suspicion is bound to fall on republican dissidents opposed to the peace process. The incident comes only days after a
mortar bomb failed to detonate outside a police station in the nearby Co Armagh village of Keady.
The chairman of the nationalist SDLP in Newry, Gary McKeown, condemned those responsible. ""Lives could have been
lost as a result of this bombing,"" he said. ""It serves absolutely no purpose and does nothing for the community, or the
cause of a united Ireland. If people want to advance their beliefs, they should enter the democratic process and debate
with their political opponents, rather than resorting to violence. Planting bombs outside courthouses will achieve nothing.""
Earlier this month, police on both sides of the Irish border launched separate operations against dissident republicans.
Police in Northern Ireland arrested two men and a woman in connection with the murder of Constable Stephen Carroll, the
first PSNI officer killed by terrorists in the province.
The Continuity IRA shot the 48-year-old policeman dead on a housing estate in Craigavon, County Armagh, on 9 March
last year. His murder came just 48 hours after the Real IRA killed two British soldiers outside the Massereene barracks in
Antrim. In September police discovered a massive 600lb bomb in the south Armagh village of Forkhill.
On Sunday, Republican Sinn Fein, political allies of the Continuity IRA, claimed masked undercover soldiers carried out
surveillance on two housing estates in Lurgan, Co Armagh, in recent weeks. They claimed the men were scouting the
areas in white civilian vans. Republican Sinn Fein said the soldiers belonged to the Special Reconnaissance Regiment.
The alleged presence of SRR soldiers — formerly known as the 14th Intelligence Unit — is controversial because British
troops are meant to have been pulled off the streets, especially in nationalist areas.

The Conservatives should no longer count on winning the election outright, according to a Guardian/ICM poll published
today.
The new survey suggests Britain is on course for a hung parliament amid faltering public support for David Cameron's
party.
The opposition have also lost ground on key policy issues, including the economy, and in particular may be losing their
campaign against Labour's so-called ""death tax"". Labour leads the Tories by eight points as the party with the best policy
on care for the elderly.
The two parties are neck and neck on their ability to sort out the economic crisis, against a nine-point Tory lead when the
question was last asked in August 2009.
With no more than three months to go until polling day, the Conservatives have fallen to 37%, down three on last month's
Guardian/ICM poll and down two on another ICM poll earlier this month.
The party has not fallen so low in an ICM poll since the tail end of the banking crisis, last falling to 37% in February 2008.
As recently as last October the Tories hit 45% in an ICM poll and the party will be alarmed by this latest evidence that the
race is tightening, which confirms the findings of some other recent polls.
Meanwhile Labour's support, at 30%, is eight points up on its absolute ICM bottom last May, and slightly above its
average for the second part of last year. However, there is no sign of either a boost for the party following Gordon Brown's
Piers Morgan interview or a fall after this weekend's reports about Brown bullying his staff.
Labour's support is up one point on the last Guardian/ICM poll and unchanged from the most recent ICM poll. Research
began last Friday and most was carried out before the serialisation of Andrew Rawnsley's book in yesterday's Observer,
which may have affected Labour support. Around a fifth of responses were collected on Sunday.
Nick Clegg's hopes of a powerful place in a hung parliament are also boosted by today's poll, which puts the Liberal
Democrats on 20%, unchanged from the most recent ICM and down one on last month's Guardian poll.
All this suggests that Labour and the Lib Dems are holding steady while the Conservatives lose some ground to smaller
parties, which are on a total of 13%. Nationalists are on 5%, Ukip and the Greens on 3% each and the BNP on 2%.
Estimates of what these shares would mean for the parties on polling day vary, but a 7% lead is at the margins of what
the Tories think they need to win a majority. One academic calculation suggests the result would leave Labour only 25
seats behind the Tories in a hung parliament, although any improved Tory performance in marginal seats would offset
that.

Car bomb explodes in Northern Ireland
Republican dissidents suspected after blast outside courthouse in Newry as evacuation was taking place

A car bomb exploded last night outside the courthouse in Newry, Northern Ireland, police said. There were no initial
reports of any injuries in the blast.
Police said the vehicle was abandoned at the front of the building in the Co Down town at around lOpm. Officers were in
the process of evacuating the area when the car exploded.
Suspicion is bound to fall on republican dissidents opposed to the peace process. The incident comes only days after a
mortar bomb failed to detonate outside a police station in the nearby Co Armagh village of Keady.
The chairman of the nationalist SDLP in Newry, Gary McKeown, condemned those responsible. ""Lives could have been
lost as a result of this bombing,"" he said. ""It serves absolutely no purpose and does nothing for the community, or the
cause of a united Ireland. If people want to advance their beliefs, they should enter the democratic process and debate
with their political opponents, rather than resorting to violence. Planting bombs outside courthouses will achieve nothing.""
Earlier this month, police on both sides of the Irish border launched separate operations against dissident republicans.
Police in Northern Ireland arrested two men and a woman in connection with the murder of Constable Stephen Carroll, the
first PSNI officer killed by terrorists in the province.
The Continuity IRA shot the 48-year-old policeman dead on a housing estate in Craigavon, County Armagh, on 9 March
last year. His murder came just 48 hours after the Real IRA killed two British soldiers outside the Massereene barracks in
Antrim. In September police discovered a massive 600lb bomb in the south Armagh village of Forkhill.
On Sunday, Republican Sinn Fein, political allies of the Continuity IRA, claimed masked undercover soldiers carried out
surveillance on two housing estates in Lurgan, Co Armagh, in recent weeks. They claimed the men were scouting the
areas in white civilian vans. Republican Sinn Fein said the soldiers belonged to the Special Reconnaissance Regiment.
The alleged presence of SRR soldiers — formerly known as the 14th Intelligence Unit — is controversial because British
troops are meant to have been pulled off the streets, especially in nationalist areas.

BISHKEK, Kyrgyzstan (AP) - As minority Uzbeks flee the Central Asian nation of Kyrgyzstan by the thousands, Russia is
sending in a battalion of paratroopers to protect its air base in the country. More than 100 people have been killed and
about 1250 wounded in four days of ethnic violence spreading across southern Kyrgyzstan. Doctors and rights activists
say the actual toll is likely far higher than that official count, because wounded Uzbeks are too afraid of being attacked
again to go to hospitals. Mobs of ethnic Kyrgyz have been reportedly torching Uzbek villages and neighborhoods,
slaughtering residents. Authorities in Uzbekistan says more than 75,000 refugees have fled its neighbor. Most are said
to be women, children and the elderly, and many have gunshot wounds. While the Kremlin has refused Kyrgyzstan's
request for military help quelling the violence, the Interfax news agency reports Russia has sent about 300 paratroopers
to reinforce security at its air base. Kyrgyzstan hosts both U.S. and Russian military air bases, but they are in the north,
away from the ethnic rioting.

Re: Game back on, NI
Shaun just called, 7:50 pm EST, to relate the latest sequence and to tell you that after near breakdown of
negotiations on Monday they are back on track (maybe). Robinson went into his assembly on Monday thinking
he could pull off the deal, but was shocked to discover the degree of opposition, centering partly on Reg Empey
(UUP). (Cameron has tried to forge an alliance of UUP, elements of DUP and the Tories, on the agenda at the
secret country house meeting last week.) But tonight, Wednesday, Shaun has got Robinson and McGuiness to
agree to all points, pushing past the previous sticking point on the Minister of Justice and relation to the
Executive. The matter now rests with Robinson and his ability to sell it tomorrow. He has told Shaun and
Gordon he believes he can do it. He needs 75 percent of his party. So, the perils of peace continue.

Re: Northern Ireland crisis and latest UK coup
The political crisis in Northern Ireland is fast moving and fluid. On Friday, January 7, after reading a lengthy
statement on TV denouncing his wife repeatedly for her affair (with a teenager), Peter Robinson assured Shaun
Woodward privately that no financial irregularity was involved. Then, within hours, it was reported that Iris
Robinson secured 50,000 pounds from government contractors to give to her lover to set up a restaurant. Peter
Robinson in fact knew of the money all along. Robinson had an opportunity to save himself, perhaps, by
declaring himself for engagement on devolution, freeing himself of the DUP hardliners and throwing himself on
public opinion, but was incapable of acting. By accepting his withdrawal as First Minister for six weeks today,
the DUP has maintained a modicum of Robinson's authority, though it is in suspended animation. His
temporary replacement, Arlene Foster, according to Shaun, comes from the modernizing wing of the party.
Shaun does not know if her naming indicates a potetinally positive direction or makes her a prisoner of those
who put her in place. The silence of Sinn Fein is telling. Not reacting in horror, Sinn Fein is unsure whether this
is good or bad news, and it's willing to wait. But the waiting game is untenable without forward movement on
devolution.
Here's why: Without positive steps from Foster and the DUP, the situation will become swiftly unacceptable to
Sinn Fein. It will speak out. Martin McGuinness will have to express his opposition to DUP recalcitrance and
paralysis. Earlier, Shaun sent signals to leaders of the DUP that Robinson's resignation would provoke a series
of events leading rapidly to Shaun calling an election in which they would be tainted by him and suffer a
catastrophic defeat, followed by the general UK election (almost certainly May 6) that would compound their
misery. Shaun was trying to push them not to scuttle the peace process but to embrace it and move forward.
Robinson's six weeks hiatus puts the DUP in a fugue state, a twilight zone of disorientation, that cannot be
sustained even this week. Shaun is also working through the Irish government to communicate to Adams not to

There's more to come, hour by hour, but the situation remains extremely murky. It should clairfy within days.
On the latest coup attempt against Gordon: The plotters, Patricia Hewitt and Geoffrey Hoon, had no one behind
them. It was a fizzle. This is the third and likely the last attempt. It's the end of the coup season. Ironically, the
coup was announced just as Gordon had had his best week, last week, after David Cameron flip-flopped on a
marriage tax and Gordon walloped him in Question Time. The coup obviously halted that momentum and
shifted the subject to disunity within the Labour Party. Gordon and Labour lost a bit of time and ground it will
have to make up. But various polls show almost no negative movement of Gordon in a matchup with Cameron.
He has pulled to within ten points and remains steady. However, a poll in the Guardian today shows that while
Gordon has actually improved his standing within the party the party itslef has taken a hit.
David Miliband was the loser in this coup attempt. He took seven hours before responding, issuing a tepid
statement saying he expected that labour would win under Gordon's leadership. His vacillation marked him.
Niether willing to strike nor support, he seems unsure, wobbly. His performance has made people wonder if
he's the man to be leader after Gordon. David's brother, Ed, the environment minister, meanwhile, reacting
swiftly in his backing of Gordon, and has emerged as a sterling fellow. Mandelson, for his part, waited to go on
TV to express his public support. No one trusts him, yet he's indispensable. If somehow Gordon wins, he would
likely be the first one defenestrated. More to come soon...

Dearest Cheryl -
You are so good at what you do. I was reminded of it this morning when I heard you on NPR. You're the
perfect person to be on the ground dealing with the operation and also translating for the public what is going
on. I know you don't enjoy doing press, but you are very good at it and I think it is important for the American
public to understand the mission of the U.S. government and the high respect and deference you are giving to
the Haitian government. You really got that across this morning.
Sending you lots of love and good luck in your incredibly important mission.

Just FYI on the below, from one of those crazy right ""magazines"" - notes that the home you referenced in your Prayer
Breakfast remarks has since closed.
I checked in with Lissa & Melanne, they didn't know it closed, which makes sense since it happened in 2002 after you left
the White House.
I made it clear that your longtime commitment to this issue - throughout your public career - is well known, and you
remain very proud of your work with Mother Teresa in opening this home in 1995. And that your partnership is a
success story to be emulated.
Again, this is just FYI

ADOPTION I Hillary Clinton continues to hail an adoption home she helped open with Mother Teresa that has since
closed its doors By Emily Belz
WASHINGTON—An adoption ministry Secretary of State Hillary Clinton hailed as a home she helped open with Mother
Teresa no longer handles adoptions and its phone line has been disconnected, though at last week's National Prayer
Breakfast Clinton spent five minutes of her 30-minute speech relating the story of its opening. Last Thursday Clinton
described Mother Teresa ""beaming about what this meant for children and their futures,"" seemingly oblivious that the
Mother Teresa Home for Infant Children in northwest Washington, D.C., is now defunct. She said she worked tirelessly
to ""cut through all the red tape,"" although it appears that red tape prevented the work from continuing. According to a
pastor at the church next door to the home's former location, the adoption ministry failed to take off because the
Roman Catholic nuns who ran it weren't allowed to care for babies without medical personnel on site. ""I'm not sure the

legal thing that came down upon them, but they realized they needed to expend their energies in another way,"" said
Maureen Freshour, who along with her husband, David, pastors Chevy Chase Baptist Church and lives nearby. Freshour
has stayed in touch with the nuns from the Missionaries of Charity order who ran the home and said that the remaining
three or four sisters have moved to another house in Washington, where they are ministering to the homeless.""This has
been a core issue—adoption—whether the home [Clinton] talked about survived or not,"" said Chuck Johnson, chief
operating officer of the National Council for Adoption. ""It's an issue she's been consistent on.""During her speech on
Thursday, Clinton reminisced about the 1994 National Prayer Breakfast when she attended as first lady and Mother
Teresa was the speaker. The Roman Catholic nun delivered a blistering speech about abortion, saying, ""Any country that
accepts abortion is not teaching its people to love, but to use any violence to get what they want."" Mother Teresa then
called on attendees to fight abortion through adoption: ""Please don't kill the child. I want the child. Please give me the
child.""The audience that day gave her a standing ovation—but President and Mrs. Clinton, both pro-abortion, did not
stand. Afterward, Mother Teresa asked to meet with Hillary Clinton and they went to talk behind a curtain on the stage,
sitting on folding chairs, Mother Teresa in sandals even though it was winter.""She told me that she knew that we had a
shared conviction about adoption being vastly better as a choice for unplanned or unwanted babies,"" Clinton related last
Thursday. ""And she asked me—or more properly, she directed me—to work with her to create a home for such babies
here in Washington.""Clinton followed through and set up a home for unwanted babies in Washington in just over a year,
no small feat in a city that was known then for its inefficient and corrupt bureaucracy. The Mother Teresa Home for
Infant Children opened in June 1995 in the district's affluent Chevy Chase neighborhood to house eight pregnant
mothers and their babies—but it remains unclear whether it facilitated any adoptions.I called the Missionaries of Charity
in Washington, a worldwide Roman Catholic order established by Mother Teresa. The nun who answered the phone said
she couldnit give her name because they aren't allowed to talk to the press. She did say, however, that the sisters who
are in the order now were not in the order when the adoption home opened, so she wasn't sure why it closed. She
added that the order sold the Chevy Chase house in 2002. ""We work with the poor and we didn't have any work there
because it's a rich neighborhood,"" she said. The sisters, she added, are now working with the homeless and those with
AIDS in a more transitional neighborhood in the northeast section of town on Otis Street.

Religion and human rights
The limits of freedom and faith
Mar 31st 2010
From The Economist print edition
Opponents of a bid by Muslim states to ""protect religion"" claim a small success
How dare you call us blasphemers?
IT DOES not happen often: Christian lobbyists, the sort who favour prayer in American classrooms and
crucifixes in Italian ones, lining up on the same side as secularists who battle to curb religion's role in the
public square. But in both those camps there has been some quiet satisfaction after a recent vote at the
United Nations. Not over the outcome, but over the slim margin of defeat.
On March 25th the Human Rights Council (HRC), a Geneva-based UN agency which often exasperates its
Western members, voted by 20 votes to 17, with eight abstentions, for a text that lists the ""defamation of
religion"" as an infringement of liberty. Nothing amazing there: the Organisation of the Islamic Conference
(OIC), which groups 56 mainly Muslim states (plus Palestine), has been working to push resolutions of
that kind through the General Assembly and other UN bodies since 2005. But the margin was the smallest
ever, and opponents think there could be a good chance of defeating a ""defamation"" motion next time one
comes around.
The OIC's idea is to establish the principle that faiths need protection, just as individuals do. It denies any
sinister intention (see article). And to some ears, the OIC's effort sounds like harmless UN-speak, but
nothing more. (The United States Commission on International Religious Freedom, a congressionally
mandated body, has noted a logical flaw: defamation means harming the reputation of a living person or
entity: that implies that one can't defame an idea or a religious founder who is no longer, at least
physically, alive on earth.)
But critics of the OIC campaign, who include atheists, Christians and indeed some Muslims, say the
""defamation"" idea is worse than hot air: far from protecting human rights, it emboldens countries that use
blasphemy laws to criminalise dissent. What encourages these critics is that more countries seem to be
coming around to their view. Mexico, Uruguay, Argentina, Zambia and South Korea voted against the
latest resolution. Brazil criticised the text but abstained.
Deeper still inside the UN's bureaucracy, another battle over religion rages—and the stakes could be even
higher. An ""ad hoc committee"" is mulling ways to amend or extend the UN convention on racial
discrimination. Certain states want language that would fuse the categories of race and faith; some want a
new convention, or a protocol to the existing one.
For secularists (in the broad sense of people, including believers, who oppose the idea of faith having
privileged access to power), all this is alarming. Non-binding resolutions against defamation are bad
enough; a UN treaty on race-plus-religion would have legal force, at least for its signatories, and give
heart to theocrats.
At the HRC's latest discussion of this effort in March, the Algerian who oversees the project was keen to
plough ahead. But countries like Switzerland, Japan, Mexico, Argentina and France retorted that it would
be better to enforce the existing UN norms than dream up new ones. Efforts to widen the racism accord
will resume, with a new chairman, late this year—but critics are relieved to have stalled it. Still, would-be
theocrats may now focus harder on adding to the racism charter, because they face a real risk of being
defeated over defamation, in the view of Roy Brown, Geneva spokesman for the International Humanist
and Ethical Union.
Meanwhile a Christian-inspired NGO, the European Centre for Law and Justice, has been denouncing the
abuse of blasphemy laws in many OIC member states. How fair is their point? It is an easy case to make,
for example, over Pakistan.
Some 41 complaints of blasphemy were registered by police in Pakistan last year, says that country's
independent Human Rights Commission. In theory, blasphemy is punishable by death—a penalty that has
been handed down but never carried out. Worst-hit by the law are minorities like Christians and Ahmadis,
a group whose claim to be Muslim is rejected by the Pakistani state. Although abuse of the law is less rife
now than in the 1980s, when an Islamist general tightened up the rules, the law is still invoked in disputes
(over property, say) that have nothing to do with faith.
""The most vulnerable people, that is religious minorities, continue to be charged with
blasphemy,"" said Ali Dayan Hasan, a researcher at Human Rights Watch, a campaign group.
""But are people convicted? No. Rarely. It is used as an instrument of political and social
coercion.""
When convictions occur, they lead to long jail terms; and pre-trial detention can last for years. Pakistan's
parliament is revising the constitution but it has left intact the religious bits, despite a vow by the ruling
party to review the blasphemy laws. (Indonesia too has stepped back from a move to liberalise its
blasphemy regime.)
On Pakistani streets, the law has dire effects. In January 2009, in a village in Punjab province, five
Ahmadis, a labourer and four children, were charged with blasphemy. They had supposedly written
""Prophet Muhammad"" on the wall of a mosque toilet. The children were behind bars for nearly six months
till the charge was quashed.
And last September a young Pakistani Christian was accused of throwing part of the Koran down a drain.
It seems that his real crime, however, was affection for a Muslim woman. A mob torched a church, and
many Christians had to flee. He was taken to jail, where he died a few days later. His family alleged
torture; the authorities claimed suicide. There was mayhem at the funeral and the country's Christians
(see picture) were appalled. In some places, it is not the ""defamation"" of faith that threatens rights but
measures that supposedly defend it.","UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05768055 Date: 08/31/2015

Below and attached is a proposed draft for a speech next Thursday at CFR. You'll recall that we discussed this with you
at the last speech meeting. The idea is to give a speech one year after your last CFR address that updates and amplifies
the frame you outlined, and fills it in with the work of the past year. The speech will also underscore the continuity
between your speech and the National Security Strategy.
The below draft still needs a good bit of work, but we have between now and next Thursday to get it into shape. AMS

Faisal Shahzad, the American of Pakistani descent who is in custody in the United States over the failed attack. He did

MS. Judith A McHale, US Under Secretary of State for Public Affairs, who was recently in Dhaka, is the senior most
ranking US Government official to visit Bangladesh since President Obama took office in USA and Sheikh Hasina in
Bangladesh. During her public engagements, she made some remarks that are very encouraging for Bangladesh. In
Dhaka University she said that US would take 20,000 students every year from Bangladesh where at the moment, the
intake is far fewer.
The Under Secretary made more encouraging remarks when she addressed Madrassah students of Uttar Badda Islamia
Kamil Madrassah. When a student informed her that Madrassah educated students are seldom given US visa for
education, she said categorically that US doors are open to Madrassah educated students of Banagladesh. She also said
that the US Embassy is providing teachers for teaching English in Madrassahs and her Government ""is proud to be
working with the Madrassah."" She also said that religious leadership is a key to the success of socio-economic
development efforts. Her most positive remark was her belief that Bangladesh could assist the US to bridge its gap with
the Muslim world.
The Under Secretary however did not say how many Madrassah students who would be given visa annually as she did
for the general students.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05767282 Date: 08/31/2015
This notwithstanding, the fact that a senior Obama administration official has publicly made positive remarks for the
Madrassah educated students and role of Islam in society is very significant. Her statement came on the back of a
number of other initiatives that the US Government has taken in Bangladesh to work with the Madrasahs. The US
Government is working with a number of NGOs to sensitize Madrassah students on democracy, information and
communication technology, etc.
This is a significant change in US stance on Bangladesh. Not very long ago, the US Ambassador to Bangladesh Harry
Thomas was crying hoarse about religious fundamentalism in Bangladesh; that was dismissed by the BNP Government.
The Awami League went overboard to spread the news that Bangladesh was seething with religious fundamentalism,
even labeling the BNP Government as ""Taliban"". Early in 2006, the US Assistant Secretary for South Asia, Ms. Christina
Rocco, on an official visit to Bangladesh, strongly advised the Government that it had no choice but to rein in the
religious fundamentalists, that later led to the arrests of Bangla Bhai and the JMB terrorists. The BNP Government
arrested religious terrorists in a make believe manner that was a far cry from the dangerous portrayal about them in the
media and by the opposition, when they were at the height of their criminal activities.
The meekness of their surrender and their execution under the Caretaker Government without any repercussion from
their cadres who were supposed to on the verge of capturing power by force left no doubt that the case of religious
extremists in Bangladesh was over politicised and overstated. They raised their ugly face in no uncertain terms because
the BNP Government indulged and encouraged them. The national elections in December 2008, in which over 20 million
first time voters entered the election process further sealed the nation's contempt for political parties in Bangladesh
that use religion for achieving their ends. In fact, even the BNP found the religion based parties a political liability in the
last elections when the biggest of the religion based parties in Bangladesh, the Jamat-e-Islami could manage just 2 seats.
Although the parties that have used religion for politics have been historically rejected by voters in Bangladesh,
interestingly Islam as a religion has made significant inroads into the lives of the overwhelming majority of its people
since independence. There are many reasons for this that is outside the scope of this writing. This spread of Islam, unlike
in many other countries, is still tampered by liberal traditions embedded in the history of the religion in this part of the
world where Sufism has played a major role. Nevertheless, the resurgence of Islam in Bangladesh also faces the dangers
of evolving in the opposition direction. It is an issue that must be dealt with the utmost caution to deter Bangladesh
from following Algeria or Afghanistan.
Soon after the Awami League came to power early last year, a vested group was busy spreading distorted information to
create public opinion against the Qoami Madrasahs (QM) and calling for restoration of secularism by removing Islam
from public life. A World Bank Report later trashed the propaganda against QM, one that suggested that under BNP
Government 35% soldiers recruited were from QM. There was a period of lull in the campaign of this group against Islam
based political parties and the Madrasahs after the WB report, although the report may not have been alone responsible
for the lull.. The annulment of the fifth amendment of the constitution, the war trial criminals that would involve mostly
the Jamat; and the recent activities of Jamat's student cadre in the universities have re-activated the move. A section is
claiming the restoration of the 1972 constitution to ban the Jamat.
Ms Judith McHale's visit is very significant in the present context of Bangladesh's politics. Unlike Ms Christina Rocco's
visit in early 2006, she did not sound any alarm bells for Bangladesh on the issue of religious fundamentalism. To the
contrary, her visit to the Madrassah, together with the initiatives of her Government to work with the Madrasahs of
Bangladesh by providing them with modern educational tools are positive signs that US is not worried about 'religious
fundamentalism' in Bangladesh and that it even visualises a role for Bangladesh to help it reach out more towards the
Muslim world. Some months ago, the US Government dropped the name of Bangladesh from the watch list of countries
where religious freedom is at stake. This is another indication that religious fundamentalism in Bangladesh is on the
decline in US perception

From Gary Sick
Mojtaba Samareh Hashemi is a senior adviser to President Ahmadinejad and a devoted proponent of the Divine Right of
Kings doctrine of ultra-conservative ayatollah Mesbah-Yazdi. Many regard him as an eminence grise of the Iranian regime
and an important bridge between the Revolutionary Guards, the fanatic-fringe ayatollahs, and the presidency. So his
words are worth listening to as clues to what is happening inside the closed circles of the Iranian leadership.
Today he was quoted by the Fars news agency (in Persian) on the troublesome issue of U.S.-Iran relations. Although the
statement was translated into English, it needs more than a word-for-word translation in order to be understood. So I have
added my own interpretation of what Mojtaba really meant to say.
""Obama not only did not manage to realize his slogan [of change], but has pursued the dark policies of Bush all over the
world ever more energetically...""
[real meaning: Oh, how we miss George Bush! He was such an easy target. With him we were winning everywhere and
America's credibility was falling to the point of disappearance even among its friends.]
""The Bush presidency is one of the darkest eras of the United States and the greatest hatred emerged internationally
towards the United States...""
[Why can't Obama be more like Bush? In the good old days we didn't have to keep answering questions about why we
would not accept an outstretched hand of friendship. It was all so much easier then.]
""Today we see that the United States rather than moving its military forces out of Iraq and Afghanistan has increased their
number which has led to mass murder of the people and increased impoverishment in these countries. Obama had said
that he wanted to oppose violation of human rights and wanted to close Guantanamo and secret prisons in Europe. Did
this happen? Of course not...""
[The United States has announced its withdrawal from Iraq and actually seems to be on schedule; in the meantime, our
favorite parties and politicians in Iraq have not done all that well in the Iraqi elections despite our support. The Shi'i
religious leaders in Najaf openly dismiss the idea of an Islamic Republic and are increasingly competing with us, instead
of following our lead. In Afghanistan, the Americans seem to be serious about announcing a date certain for withdrawal,
and they even seem to be edging up to a Karzai reconciliation strategy with the Taliban. How can we attack them with a
straight face when they behave this way!]
""There has also not been any correction of the dark policy of Bush towards Iran's nuclear program or [the United State's]
opposition towards the Iranian nation...""
[Their willingness to meet with us and that dastardly offer of a uranium swap were hugely embarrassing. Now every time
we sit down with a foreign leader we have to listen to tiresome suggestions that we should reconsider our position on the
uranium swap — even from the Russians and Chinese. You can't trust anyone these days!]
""We do not want anything from the United States. The Iranian nation demands its rights to be recognized and
respected...""
[All we want from the Americans is the return of George Bush! Even John McCain would be an improvement. I wonder if
Sarah Palin has any chance? We'll keep our fingers crossed.]
""The Islamic Republic has not become isolated, rather, it is expanding [its foreign relations] ever more and is finding new
friends... if they have claims, they must show it in their actions so the Iranian nation gradually trusts them...""
[We have never been so alone since the earliest years of the revolution. Even dictators and police states are privately
expressing sympathy to us for the way our crackdown on the Green Movement attracted sympathetic attention all over the
world. And it's all the fault of that *&!*Obama and the %$#! internet. The shah never had all these problems. Ah, for the
good old days...]","UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05768859 Date: 08/31/2015

h: FYI, Iran document Gary Sick sent me. Sid
From Gary Sick
Mojtaba Samareh Hashemi is a senior adviser to President Ahmadinejad and a devoted proponent of the Divine Right of
Kings doctrine of ultra-conservative ayatollah Mesbah-Yazdi. Many regard him as an eminence grise of the Iranian regime
and an important bridge between the Revolutionary Guards, the fanatic-fringe ayatollahs, and the presidency. So his
words are worth listening to as clues to what is happening inside the closed circles of the Iranian leadership.
Today he was quoted by the Fars news agency (in Persian) on the troublesome issue of U.S.-Iran relations. Although the
statement was translated into English, it needs more than a word-for-word translation in order to be understood. So I have
added my own interpretation of what Mojtaba really meant to say.
""Obama not only did not manage to realize his slogan [of change], but has pursued the dark policies of Bush all over the
world ever more energetically...""
[real meaning: Oh, how we miss George Bush! He was such an easy target. With him we were winning everywhere and
America's credibility was falling to the point of disappearance even among its friends.]
""The Bush presidency is one of the darkest eras of the United States and the greatest hatred emerged internationally
towards the United States...""
[Why can't Obama be more like Bush? In the good old days we didn't have to keep answering questions about why we
would not accept an outstretched hand of friendship. It was all so much easier then.]
""Today we see that the United States rather than moving its military forces out of Iraq and Afghanistan has increased their
number which has led to mass murder of the people and increased impoverishment in these countries. Obama had said
that he wanted to oppose violation of human rights and wanted to close Guantanamo and secret prisons in Europe. Did
this happen? Of course not...""
[The United States has announced its withdrawal from Iraq and actually seems to be on schedule; in the meantime, our
favorite parties and politicians in Iraq have not done all that well in the Iraqi elections despite our support. The Shi'i
religious leaders in Najaf openly dismiss the idea of an Islamic Republic and are increasingly competing with us, instead
of following our lead. In Afghanistan, the Americans seem to be serious about announcing a date certain for withdrawal,
and they even seem to be edging up to a Karzai reconciliation strategy with the Taliban. How can we attack them with a
straight face when they behave this way!]
""There has also not been any correction of the dark policy of Bush towards Iran's nuclear program or [the United State's]
opposition towards the Iranian nation...""
[Their willingness to meet with us and that dastardly offer of a uranium swap were hugely embarrassing. Now every time
we sit down with a foreign leader we have to listen to tiresome suggestions that we should reconsider our position on the
uranium swap — even from the Russians and Chinese. You can't trust anyone these days!]
""We do not want anything from the United States. The Iranian nation demands its rights to be recognized and
respected...""
[All we want from the Americans is the return of George Bush! Even John McCain would be an improvement. I wonder if
Sarah Palin has any chance? We'll keep our fingers crossed.]
""The Islamic Republic has not become isolated, rather, it is expanding [its foreign relations] ever more and is finding new

friends... if they have claims, they must show it in their actions so the Iranian nation gradually trusts them...""
[We have never been so alone since the earliest years of the revolution. Even dictators and police states are privately
expressing sympathy to us for the way our crackdown on the Green Movement attracted sympathetic attention all over the
world. And it's all the fault of that *&!*Obama and the %$#! internet. The shah never had all these problems. Ah, for the

Reid: Shelby Has Hold On All Nominees
Friday, Feb. 5, 2010
Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., has placed a blanket hold on all executive nominations on the Senate calendar in an effort
to win concessions from the Obama administration and Pentagon on a variety of fronts affecting his home state, according
to aides to Senate Majority Leader Reid.
Reid spokeswoman Regan Lachapelle said Shelby is blocking more than 70 pending nominations. Reid can force a vote
on any nomination by filing cloture.
Because of the time required to vote on multiple nominations, the Senate processes most nominations by unanimous
consent. Any one senator can block any of those nominations by objecting to a unanimous consent request to take it up.
The nominations will remain stalled unless Reid files cloture.
While holds are frequent, Senate aides said a blanket hold represents a far more aggressive use of the power than is
normal.
""He should not be holding up 70-plus nominees for a parochial issue,"" a Democratic aide said. ""They're qualified and they
should be moving forward.""
Disclosure of the blanket hold came after two days in which top Democrats voiced mounting frustration with Republican
holds on executive nominees.
'We've got a huge backlog of folks who are unanimously viewed as well qualified -- nobody has a specific objection to
them -- but end up having a hold on them because of some completely unrelated piece of business,"" President Obama
said Wednesday in a televised meeting with Senate Democrats.
On the Senate floor Thursday, Reid, Senate Majority Whip Durbin, Senate Judiciary Chairman Patrick Leahy and
Senate Armed Services Chairman Carl Levin ripped Republicans for holds on national security nominees and judges.
Reid, who kept the Senate in pro forma session over recent holidays to prevent former President George W. Bush from
making recess appointments, said he has grown so frustrated he might advocate such appointments, which the president
can make when the Senate is out of session.
'What alternatives do we have?"" Reid said on the floor Thursday. ""What alternative do we have?""
Earlier in the day, a spokesman for Shelby said the senator has placed holds on ""several pending nominees due to
unaddressed national security concerns,"" including frustrations with the Air Force's handling of the competition for an
aerial refueling tanker. The spokesman did not respond to later requests for comment about the blanket hold.
Northrop Grumman Corp. and EADS, the European consortium behind Airbus, and Boeing Co. are vying for the high-
stakes contract, potentially worth $40 billion. The Northrop/EADS team would build the planes in Mobile, Ala., but has
threatened to pull out of the competition unless the Air Force makes changes to a draft request for proposals.
""Nearly 10 years after the U.S. Air Force announced plans to replace the aging tanker fleet, we still do not have a
transparent and fair acquisition process to move forward,"" the spokesman said. ""The Department of Defense must
recognize that the draft request for proposal needs to be significantly and substantively changed.""
Defense Secretary Gates Wednesday told House lawmakers the Pentagon plans to issue the final request for proposals
soon, and will proceed with the program whether or not there is a competition.
""Obviously we would like to have a competition for it, and we hope that both companies will agree to participate, but we
will move forward,"" Gates said. ""We have to have new tankers.""
In addition to the tanker issue, Shelby's spokesman said he is frustrated that the Obama administration won't build an
Alabama-based FBI center to analyze improvised explosive devices.
Shelby secured a $45 million earmark in the FY08 omnibus appropriations bill for a Terrorist Explosive Device Analytical
Center to be set up at the Army's Redstone Arsenal.
""Sen. Shelby will continue to work with the FBI to give them the capability to coordinate intelligence as well as forensic
and technical exploitation related to IEDs, but this administration's coddling of terrorists makes this an uphill effort,"" the
spokesman said. ""He has made the administration aware of these concerns and is willing to discuss them at any time.""
Also Thursday, Vice President Biden said he was so frustrated by Republican foot-dragging that he was considering
whether Senate rules should be changed.
""There's a little disappointment in that it seems like the only way to do business up here anymore is with a supermajority
on almost everything,"" Biden said moments after swearing in Sen. Scott Brown, R-Mass., who gives Republicans 41
votes, enough to filibuster on any issue.
'What I have been doing is spending a lot of time having my staff go back and scrub this, you know, the use of the
filibuster and how it's worked,"" Biden said. ""This is not a constitutional requirement.""
Biden defended the 60-vote requirement, calling it ""a useful tool. It's legitimate, but from my perspective having served
here, having been elected seven times, I've never seen a time when it's become sort of standard operating procedure. ...
Requiring a supermajority is just not a good way to do business.""

The Israeli Media's Flotilla Fail
On 06.22.10, By Max Blumenthal
My summaty of the Israeli media's shambolic performance following the flotilla massacre was originally published here in
Hebrew at Dvorit Shargal's excellent Israeli media blog, Velvet Underground. The English version follows:
If the raid of the Gaza Freedom Flotilla was a disaster for the Israel Defense Forces, its aftermath demonstrated an
equally bewildering performance by the Israeli media. The IDF Spokesman's Office churned out one misleading claim
after another, each one more implausible than the next, seeking to implant in the public's mind a version of events that
bore little relation to reality. To a degree, this was to be expected; but it was startling to see how some of Israel's most
respected reporters lined up to serve as military stenographers, barely challenging the IDF's rapidly changing versions of
events. IDF claims about the flotilla passengers' links to Al Qaida, anti-Semitic statements shouted at the Israeli Navy, and
their terrorist intentions were eagerly broadcast by the Israeli media without a second thought. When independent
reporters forced the IDF to retract or ""clarify"" all of these claims, Israeli news outlets refused to correct their errors, or
covered them up without acknowledgment.
It so happened that I arrived in Israel for a research trip the day after the flotilla raid. As a result, I was able to do
something which I always thought to be a very basic journalistic practice, so basic it's supposed to be applied routinely:
Asking an implicated party in a story to produce evidence for its claims. What I found bewildering is that at least judging
from Israeli media reports, few, if any, mainstream reporters applied this practice, and when a visiting colleague did their
job for them – nobody bothered to correct or withdraw their original report.
On June 2, the IDF disseminated a press release entitled, ""Attackers of the IDF soldiers found to be Al Qaeda
mercenaries."" The accusation was not accompanied by any conclusive evidence — the IDF reported that Mavi Marmara
passengers were equipped with night-vision goggles (gasp!). This did not stop Yedioth's Ron Ben-Yishai, who was
embedded with the Navy commandos, from amplifying the baseless charge. Citing an ""interrogation"" of Marmara
passengers — ""lynchers,"" he called them — Ben-Yishai wrote the same day, ""Some among the [flotilla passengers] are
believed to have ties with World Jihad groups, mainly Al Qaeda."" The article made no reference to any efforts on part of
Ben Yishai to investigate this claim, nor did he seem to think to ask why the IDF was about to release dangerous
operatives of Osama Bin Laden — presumably they would attack again, wouldn't they? •
On June 3, Israeli journalist Lia Tarachansky of the Real News Network and I placed calls to the IDF Spokesman's Office
to demand further evidence of the Marmara's Al Qaeda ties. We received identical responses from spokespeople from the
IDF's Israel and North America desks: ""We don't have any evidence. The press release was based on information from
the National Security Council."" Hours later, the IDF retracted its claim, changing the title of its press release to, ""Attackers
of IDF Soldiers Found Without Identification Papers."" Despite the official retraction, Ben-Yishai's article remains
uncorrected.
On June 4, the IDF released an audio clip purporting to consist of transmissions between the Mavi Marmara and a Naval
warship. ""Go back to Aushwitz!"" a Marmara passenger shouted, according to the IDF. YNet and Haaretz reported on and
reproduced the audio clip without investigating its authenticity. Forget that the voice uttering the anti-Semitic slur sounded
like a mentally disturbed teenager; had reporters performed a cursory search of the IDF Spokeman's Office website, they
would have found a longer clip released on May 31 that featured a dramatically different exchange with the Marmara with
no mention of Auschwitz. Further, the voice of flotilla organizer Huwaida Arraf was featured in the ""Aushwitz"" clip, yet Arraf
was not aboard the Marmara (she was on the Challenger One). Could the IDF have doctored audio to exploit public
hysteria surrounding the issue of anti-Semitism?
On my blog, I pointed out the discrepancies in the IDF's footage and raised the question of doctoring. The next day, the
IDF conceded that it had in fact doctored the footage, releasing a ""clarification"" and a new clip claiming to consist of the
""full"" exchange between the Navy and the flotilla. Unfortunately, the authenticity of the new clip was impossible to verify.
Despite the IDF's admission, YNet and Haaretz have not corrected their original reports, though Haaretz has at least
altered its headline. Once the doctoring was exposed, the New York Times covered the episode in detail, directing
international attention to the triumph of independent online reporting and the apparent failure of Israel's parochial press
corps.
On June 7, Haaretz's Anshel Pfeffer reported on an IDF press release claiming without evidence that five flotilla
passengers had links to international terror. The press release was larded with highly implausible claims, including that
Ken O'Keefe, who runs an aid organization with Tony Blair's sister-in-law, was planning to train a Hamas commando unit
in the Gaza Strip. When I called the IDF Spokesman's Office, I learned that once again, no evidence was available to
support their press release. ""There is very limited intelligence we can give in this specific case,"" Sgt. Chen Arad told me.
""Obviously I'm unable to give you more information."" Did Pfeffer demand more evidence? If he did and was answered in
the same manner as I did, why did Haaretz publish an unsubstantiated spin as fact?
Joined by Haaretz military correspondents Avi Isacharoff and Amos Harel, Pfeffer became a channel for another daytime
deception by the IDF. On May 31, the three reporters produced an article based exclusively on testimony from Naval
commandos — the flotilla passengers' side of the story was ignored — claiming they had faced live fire and lynching
attempts from Marmara passengers. Since the story was published, the IDF has produced scant evidence to support
either accusation. The article was accompanied by a suspicious photo from the IDF Spokesman's Office depicting a
bearded Muslim man brandishing a knife and surrounded by photojournalists. Daylight beamed in from a window behind
the man. Haaretz's caption, which was sourced to the IDF, asserted that the photo was taken ""after"" the commandos had
boarded the Marmara. However, the commandos raided the ship at night, while the photo was taken during the day. Once
again, the IDF's story was fishy.
I called Sgt. Arad at the IDF Spokesman's Office to investigate. He told me he had no evidence to support the photo's
questionable caption. Soon after our phone conversation, Haaretz quietly altered the caption, removing its claim that the
photo was taken ""after"" the commando raid. For nearly a week, the false photo caption had remained intact. Why did
Haaretz suddenly change it? The only plausible explanation is that the paper received a tip from the IDF Spokesman's
Office. If true, the tip-off suggests a scandalous level of coordination between the Israeli military and the country's media.
In the wake of the flotilla raid, Israeli journalists had a unique opportunity to lead the global media's investigation into the
bloodbath that occurred on the deck of the Mavi Marmara. After all, no one had better access to the military or the
eyewitnesses aboard the flotilla. Instead, too many among the Israeli press corps allowed themselves to be conscripted
into the IDF's hapless information war, leaving the important task of investigating the raid to independent reporters who
remembered to view claims by any nation's military with extreme skepticism.
So why do well-connected, experienced reporters follow the IDF baton so willingly, and fail to follow up when IDF claims
are retracted? Is it simple bias, a desire to present their military in the best possible light, a desire so strong they abandon
their duty to their readers to verify their information? Are they afraid of sanctions, of losing contacts and access to
information? Do they fear personal reprisals? Their readers, and the world media that still relies on Israeli journalism as a
vital source of information, need to know.","UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05769936 Date: 08/31/2015

Asking an implicated party in a story to produce evidence for its claims. What I found bewildering is that at least judging
from Israeli media reports, few, if any, mainstream reporters applied this practice, and when a visiting colleague did their
job for them – nobody bothered to correct or withdraw their original report.
On June 2, the IDF disseminated a press release entitled, ""Attackers of the IDF soldiers found to be Al Qaeda
mercenaries."" The accusation was not accompanied by any conclusive evidence — the IDF reported that Mavi Marmara
passengers were equipped with night-vision goggles (gasp!). This did not stop Yedioth's Ron Ben-Yishai, who was
embedded with the Navy commandos, from amplifying the baseless charge. Citing an ""interrogation"" of Marmara
passengers — ""lynchers,"" he called them — Ben-Yishai wrote the same day, ""Some among the [flotilla passengers] are
believed to have ties with World Jihad groups, mainly Al Qaeda."" The article made no reference to any efforts on part of
Ben Yishai to investigate this claim, nor did he seem to think to ask why the IDF was about to release dangerous
operatives of Osama Bin Laden — presumably they would attack again, wouldn't they? •
On June 3, Israeli journalist Lia Tarachansky of the Real News Network and I placed calls to the IDF Spokesman's Office
to demand further evidence of the Marmara's Al Qaeda ties. We received identical responses from spokespeople from the
IDF's Israel and North America desks: ""We don't have any evidence. The press release was based on information from
the National Security Council."" Hours later, the IDF retracted its claim, changing the title of its press release to, ""Attackers
of IDF Soldiers Found Without Identification Papers."" Despite the official retraction, Ben-Yishai's article remains
uncorrected.
On June 4, the IDF released an audio clip purporting to consist of transmissions between the Mavi Marmara and a Naval
warship. ""Go back to Aushwitz!"" a Marmara passenger shouted, according to the IDF. YNet and Haaretz reported on and
reproduced the audio clip without investigating its authenticity. Forget that the voice uttering the anti-Semitic slur sounded
like a mentally disturbed teenager; had reporters performed a cursory search of the IDF Spokeman's Office website, they
would have found a longer clip released on May 31 that featured a dramatically different exchange with the Marmara with
no mention of Auschwitz. Further, the voice of flotilla organizer Huwaida Arraf was featured in the ""Aushwitz"" clip, yet Arraf
was not aboard the Marmara (she was on the Challenger One). Could the IDF have doctored audio to exploit public
hysteria surrounding the issue of anti-Semitism?
On my blog, I pointed out the discrepancies in the IDF's footage and raised the question of doctoring. The next day, the
IDF conceded that it had in fact doctored the footage, releasing a ""clarification"" and a new clip claiming to consist of the
""full"" exchange between the Navy and the flotilla. Unfortunately, the authenticity of the new clip was impossible to verify.
Despite the IDF's admission, YNet and Haaretz have not corrected their original reports, though Haaretz has at least
altered its headline. Once the doctoring was exposed, the New York Times covered the episode in detail, directing

international attention to the triumph of independent online reporting and the apparent failure of Israel's parochial press
corps.
On June 7, Haaretz's Anshel Pfeffer reported on an IDF press release claiming without evidence that five flotilla
passengers had links to international terror. The press release was larded with highly implausible claims, including that
Ken O'Keefe, who runs an aid organization with Tony Blair's sister-in-law, was planning to train a Hamas commando unit
in the Gaza Strip. When I called the IDF Spokesman's Office, I learned that once again, no evidence was available to
support their press release. ""There is very limited intelligence we can give in this specific case,"" Sgt. Chen Arad told me.
""Obviously I'm unable to give you more information."" Did Pfeffer demand more evidence? If he did and was answered in
the same manner as I did, why did Haaretz publish an unsubstantiated spin as fact?
Joined by Haaretz military correspondents Avi Isacharoff and Amos Harel, Pfeffer became a channel for another daytime
deception by the IDF. On May 31, the three reporters produced an article based exclusively on testimony from Naval
commandos — the flotilla passengers' side of the story was ignored — claiming they had faced live fire and lynching
attempts from Marmara passengers. Since the story was published, the IDF has produced scant evidence to support
either accusation. The article was accompanied by a suspicious photo from the IDF Spokesman's Office depicting a
bearded Muslim man brandishing a knife and surrounded by photojournalists. Daylight beamed in from a window behind
the man. Haaretz's caption, which was sourced to the IDF, asserted that the photo was taken ""after"" the commandos had
boarded the Marmara. However, the commandos raided the ship at night, while the photo was taken during the day. Once
again, the IDF's story was fishy.
I called Sgt. Arad at the IDF Spokesman's Office to investigate. He told me he had no evidence to support the photo's
questionable caption. Soon after our phone conversation, Haaretz quietly altered the caption, removing its claim that the
photo was taken ""after"" the commando raid. For nearly a week, the false photo caption had remained intact. Why did
Haaretz suddenly change it? The only plausible explanation is that the paper received a tip from the IDF Spokesman's
Office. If true, the tip-off suggests a scandalous level of coordination between the Israeli military and the country's media.
In the wake of the flotilla raid, Israeli journalists had a unique opportunity to lead the global media's investigation into the
bloodbath that occurred on the deck of the Mavi Marmara. After all, no one had better access to the military or the
eyewitnesses aboard the flotilla. Instead, too many among the Israeli press corps allowed themselves to be conscripted
into the IDF's hapless information war, leaving the important task of investigating the raid to independent reporters who
remembered to view claims by any nation's military with extreme skepticism.
So why do well-connected, experienced reporters follow the IDF baton so willingly, and fail to follow up when IDF claims
are retracted? Is it simple bias, a desire to present their military in the best possible light, a desire so strong they abandon
their duty to their readers to verify their information? Are they afraid of sanctions, of losing contacts and access to
information? Do they fear personal reprisals? Their readers, and the world media that still relies on Israeli journalism as a
vital source of information, need to know.

So it has happened again. Nearly 18 months after the Israelis bombed Gaza to a wasteland, with barely a load of building
materials allowed in since then, Turkey has taken the brunt of an operation of humanitarian assistance gone wrong.
The UN must establish the facts impartially and independently and, if laws have been broken, those responsible must be
held to account. Political demonstrations posing as relief flotillas go wrong too easily and Israel understandably has to
prevent weapons being smuggled into Gaza. But was this really the best way to bring the ships to shore for examination?
A commando attack on civilian ships looks callous and disproportionate. No one should have been hurt, whatever the
emotions behind all this.
Why is Gaza under siege in the first place? Under international law, the Israelis are responsible as the occupying force for
the proper administration of the territory; and half the point of Israel is not to be above the law. Yet they are creating a
traumatised territory of 1.5m neighbours, many of whose children seem to want to grow up to be suicide bombers. They
are also pouring fertiliser on al-Qaida's ground.
The director of UNRWA operations in Gaza, John Ging, gave a speech in London this week entitled ""Illegal, inhuman. and
insane: a medieval siege on Gaza in 2010"". This objective humanitarian practitioner should be listened to. How has Israel,
the only democracy in its region and a symbol of the need for racially inspired violence to end, come to risk any claim to
international legitimacy in its handling of this situation?
Hamas are the enemy of Israel, but they do not have to be. They preach violent resistance too readily, yet over the past
17 months they have been trying to control the militant groups intent on threatening Israel with rockets — imperfectly
perhaps, but not a single Israeli citizen has been killed (alas, one immigrant worker was) by a rocket since the Gaza
bombing stopped in January 2009. They are also the implacable opponents of al-Qaida. They won a fair election in 2006
and claim to respect democracy. Let's test them on that. At present, Hamas security people are being sniped at by the
Israeli Defence Forces when they try to arrest other militant groups. This is genuinely getting insane.
The unwisdom of reliance on angry military responses is all the clearer when the mood in Palestine, in both the West
Bank and Gaza, is steadily moving towards a negotiated end to the occupation. I am convinced from my own direct
experience that Hamas is prepared to establish and respect a long-term ceasefire so that the talking can start without the
threat of violence, and that they would enter in good faith, if that were reciprocated, into negotiations to establish two
states in the disputed territories, Israel and Palestine, with their own rights and responsibilities under international law.
The distortion of their position, a little of it the fault of their own PR, does no side any good.
If a comprehensive negotiation is too much to expect for now, what about a first step? I believe an arrangement to end the
blockade is within reach if only Israel, Egypt and Gaza would test the possibilities of dialogue. Hamas have indicated that
they could cease all attacks on Israeli soil, close the tunnels, release Gilead Shalit and stop the import of arms into Gaza if
the blockade was ended, an agreed number of Palestinian prisoners were released and Gaza began to be rebuilt.
The Palestinians of course have work to do on their own internal reconciliation, while the relationship between Fatah in
the West Bank and Hamas in Gaza remains so bad. But the UN, the US, Russia, the EU and the Arab world must make a
much more serious attempt to test the possibilities, putting ordinary Israelis and Palestinians first, not their own political
comfort.
We are coming close to losing the chance of a two-state solution. US policy, based on a West-Bank-only approach, is
locked in a cul-de-sac if Gaza is left out of the equation, because majority Palestinian support will be lacking. Israel is
confident in the knowledge that it cannot be militarily defeated.
But that ignores the huge danger of losing the political, diplomatic, legal and moral high ground. This matters in today's
world, as the US and the UK discovered in Iraq, because government authority and public opinion interact closely, and
legitimacy breeds support.
Israel's relationship with Turkey was the key to a broader understanding with the Islamic community and others beyond
the west. That now lies in tatters. If Israel is left as the permanent occupier, or controlling a one-state structure with part of
its population downgraded or imprisoned, it will truly be a disaster for its people and what they stand for.
I hope that Hamas will not sit back and enjoy Israel's discomfiture. They have so far, for a political organisation, attracted
much too narrow a range of international support. If they wish to be widely accepted as a negotiating partner, they must
unequivocally accept the only fully justified condition set by the international Quartet — the cessation of violence —
underline that their objective is a two-state settlement, and win international friends for the ending of the occupation. In
whoever's hands, bombs, bullets, rockets and iron bars will achieve nothing. But a push for justice will.

Cheryl,
I am once again in your debt. Thank you for all the quick and sustained attention you and the State Department gave
this matter.
I owe you.
At least one good ending...
Here's what I am distributing to news organizations:
STATEMENT FROM NYU SPOKESMAN JOHN BECKMAN
""NYU is very pleased to report that we have been in touch with one of the two missing graduate students who were in Haiti. They
are together and safe and well in the Dominican Republic en route back home to the US. Details of their experience are still
emerging, but our understanding is that they were flown out of the airport near Port-au-Prince by the Coast Guard, whose men and
women we thank for their courage and perseverance.
""The University is very grateful for all the assistance we received from the State Department and other government agencies and
elected officials.
""We're overjoyed to know they are coming home, safe and sound. This is a very happy ending to this story.""

I wasn't going to bother you; little surprise that, nonetheless, this matter made its way to you...
Just so you know, Walter and I are old friends; he's married to a really close friend of mine from high
school, I think the world of them both.
ISOS thinks they can get them out, but we have no communication with the two of them, so no way to
arrange a rendezvous. They're history PhD students; they were supposed to be conducting research in
the Haitian National Archives. Their accommodations are not entirely clear — they were either at a
home in Carrefour district that belonged to the family of the young woman, or they may have been
staying in one of the two hotels recommended to them by other grad students who had studied there:
the Plaza, or the Oloffson.
We'd be grateful for anything the Dept can do. I know what a mess it is down there, and I know there
are a zillion tasks to accomplish. I also know this must be very hard on the State Dept personnel who
are posted there; my thoughts are with them.
Thanks, C. Just knowing you know about it is a relief to me
Yours,
jb

In advance of your meeting tomorrow with George Soros, below is some information in response to the letter you
received from Soros proposing increased USG support for the American University of Central Asia (AUCA). SCA favors
providing more USG support for AUCA
Since 9/11 the United States has provided more than $15 million to AUCA in support of its endowment and various
other initiatives. For a majority of these contributions the Soros Foundation matched one dollar for every two dollars
provided by the USG. The major USG contributions to AUCA were two grants to the university endowment, the first in
2003 for $10 million, the second in 2008 for $3 million. Other USG support for AUCA included funding for two advisors to
the AUCA president on accreditation and development, support for the journalism faculty, and scholarship funds for
students from Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Afghanistan to attend the university.
Soros has proposed that the USG increase this support, offering a 1-1 match of $10 million each from State and his
foundation, totaling $20 million over the next five years. Last fall SCA received the same proposal from Soros, and they
have been discussing the issue with Soros' staff.
A little bit of additional information from SCA on AUCA: The university has made significant progress this year on a
number of its key objectives and remains a unique institution in Central Asia, a place where students are judged solely
on merit and a forum for free expression and critical thinking. The university achieved an important milestone this year
related to its U.S. accreditation, signing an agreement with Bard College under which AUCA graduates starting next May
will receive full diplomas from Bard College, an institution accredited in the United States. In addition, AUCA recently
established a new partnership with the American University in Kabul facilitated through state of the art video classroom
technology and recently announced the appointment of Andrew Wachtel, from Northwestern University, as the new
AUCA president who will take office this summer.
I will include this note (in addition to Soros' letter) in your materials for your meeting with Soros tomorrow. Please let
me know if you would like any further information.

to say that the streaming on State.gov and America.gov went very well yesterday and received a lot more praise then
the UN one which required people to download software, which ours did not. :)
Also, we are working now to send the video out to posts and to let them use in their own story telling. Also, we had a

which encourages people to keep up to date on news on Haiti and to donate to the Clinton Bush Haiti Fund.

Subject: Bloomberg-South America Leaders Propose Haiti Aid, Avoid Strife (Update3)
By Alexander Cuadros
Feb. 9 (Bloomberg) -- South American leaders agreed to provide $300 million in aid to Haiti at a summit in Ecuador after
skirting regional disputes that have undermined relations on the continent since 2008.
The 12 members of the Union of South American Nations, or Unasur, endorsed an accord today calling for a $100 million
fund as well as a $200 million ""preferential"" credit from the Inter-American Development Bank. The money would be
channeled to programs benefiting Haiti's reconstruction in areas such as agriculture, electricity infrastructure, health
and education.
""Latin America has stood up,"" Ecuadorean President Rafael Correa said, addressing the summit at his presidential palace.
""The time has come to create a new kind of south-south aid.""

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05769799 Date: 08/31/2015
The meeting marks Colombian President Alvaro Uribe's first visit to Ecuador since his armed forces staged a cross-border
raid on a guerrilla camp there almost two years ago. The attack killed rebel leader Raul Reyes, prompted Correa to break
off ties with his northern neighbor and led Venezuela's Hugo Chavez to order tanks to his country's border with
Colombia.
Leaders including Organization of American States Secretary General Jose Miguel Insulza said today aid efforts should
follow instructions from the government of Haitian President Rene Preval, who attended the meeting. Correa said
member nations should scrap tariffs on Haitian imports and consider subsidizing natural gas exports to the Caribbean
nation.
IDB Support
Carlos Melo, the IDB's representative in Ecuador, said he spoke to bank chief Luis Alberto Moreno, who supported a 15-
to 20-year $200 million credit to be taken on by Unasur. Correa said member countries should consider contributing 25
cents per inhabitant to the $100 million fund.
Chavez canceled his attendance because of an electricity crisis he's facing at home, Ecuadorean Foreign Minister Ricardo
Patino told reporters today. At a gathering in Argentina last August, Chavez assailed a deal allowing the U.S. access to
seven Colombian military bases, saying it was part of a strategy to dominate the region.
About 100 protesters gathered today outside the presidential palace, carrying signs reading ""Uribe equals the threat of
war"" and chanting criticisms of Correa for receiving his Colombian counterpart.
Regional Integration
Unasur was formed two years ago in a bid to promote regional integration. In 2008, at a summit in Santiago, the group
provided political backing to Bolivian President Evo Morales after clashes between his supporters and government
opponents over a new constitution left 30 people dead.
The leaders of the continent's two biggest economies skipped today's talks. Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de
Kirchner has canceled foreign travel amid a political dispute over control of the central bank's reserves.
Brazilian President Luiz lnacio Lula da Silva isn't attending because of conflicts in his agenda, according to his press
office. He sent his top foreign policy adviser, Marco Aurelio Garcia, to represent him.
No bilateral meeting is planned between Correa and Uribe, Ecuador's state news agency cited Patino as saying Feb. 4.
Unasur countries rushed doctors, food and emergency supplies to Haiti, the hemisphere's poorest country, in the
aftermath of the Jan. 12 earthquake. At least 200,000 people died in the quake, Haiti's government said Feb. 6.
Brazil Aid
Lula signed a, decree Jan. 26 providing 375 million reais ($200 million) in aid to Haiti. Brazil, which leads a United Nations
peacekeeping contingent in Haiti, had already pledged about $17 million to the country, the most among Latin American
nations, according to UN data.
Venezuela forgave Haiti's oil-related debt and donated 225,000 barrels of fuel, while Colombia sent more than 200
search-and-rescue personnel and committed hundreds of tons of humanitarian supplies. Ecuador has sent rescue teams
and donated several tons of food, UN data show. Peruvian President Alan Garcia, speaking at the summit today, said
Peru was willing to contribute $10 million.

Colombia and Ecuador began taking steps late last year to restore full relations. The neighbors named diplomatic envoys
and re-established military ties in November. Ecuador this month also eliminated the last of the tariffs it imposed on
Colombian goods in 2009.

Subject: FW: FINAL 01-13-10 Haiti Talking Points - 0530
Importance: High
There weren't a huge number of updates over the evening, though the phones are getting more active again now. Late
this morning we learned that SYG Ban Ki Moon was in touch with AMB Rice, and told her that there were approximately
100 UN staff still buried under the rubble at MINUSTAH, SYG Ban formally requested
helicopter search and rescue teams. AMB Rice underscored that we need to make getting those SARs a priority.
I'm attaching our draft talking points from about an hour and a half ago; the background sections in particular have
some useful information. Currently, Southcom is conducting aerial reconnaissance of the airport to determine in what
sort of repair it is. The talking points note that several countries and organizations (Dominican Republic, Chile, UK, the
Netherlands, IADB) have offered assistance to Haiti (and info'd us). In addition to those on the list, the Israelis are trying
to send several urban search and rescue teams (some of the team members need help getting visas to transit Miami en
route to Port-au-Prince).
The UN Situation Center is in contact with MINUSTAH's Deputy Force Commander. They have been working to clear a
couple of major streets in Port-au-Prince, as noted in the talking points. They have also reviewed the airport, and their
Deputy Force Commander told the UN Situation Center several hours ago that the airport was functional (in the sense
that the tarmac was intact and planes could physically land).
Oren Anolik, political counselor at the Israeli Embassy, called around 2 a.m. to ask if there were any updates. We had
few updates at that time, other than to let him know that we had learned the damage to southern Haiti was much more
extensive than that in the north.

Obama's Approval Rating Dips to New Low
(CBS)
President Obama's job approval rating has fallen to 46 percent, according to a new CBS News poll.
That rating is Mr. Obama's lowest yet in CBS News polling, and the poll marks the first time his approval rating has fallen
below the 50 percent mark. Forty-one percent now say they disapprove of Mr. Obama's performance as president.
In last month's CBS News poll, 50 percent of Americans approved of how the president was handling his job, while thirty-
nine percent disapproved.
Analysis: The Irony Behind Obama's Poll Numbers
Mr. Obama still receives strong support from Democrats (eight in ten approve of his performance), but his approval rating
among Republicans is only 13 percent. More importantly, Mr. Obama's approval rating among independents has declined
10 points in recent months — and it now stands at just 42 percent.
Domestic issues — and not his response to terrorist threats - appear to be driving the president's approval rating
downward.
Just 41 percent now approve of his handling of the economy, which Americans say is the nation's most pressing issue.
Forty-seven percent disapprove. The president's marks on handling health care, with reforms still under debate in
Congress, are even lower — just 36 percent approve, while 54 percent disapprove. Both of these approval ratings are the
lowest of Mr. Obama's presidency.
Meanwhile, both parties in Congress receive even lower marks than the president on handling health care. Few
Americans think the reforms in Congress hit the right note on expanding coverage, lowering costs and regulating the
health insurance industry. (Read more on the health care poll results)
(CBS)
The president receives slightly higher ratings for his handling of the war in Afghanistan and the threat of terrorism than on
domestic issues. Forty-six percent approve of Mr. Obama's handling of Afghanistan, and 52 percent approve of how he is
handling the threat of terrorism.
While some Republicans have criticized the president and Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano's responses
to the attempted Christmas Day terror attack, most Americans don't share their opinion.
In the poll, 57 percent of Americans approve of the way the Obama administration has responded to the attempted attack,
and 29 percent disapprove. Views are highly partisan — 75 percent of Democrats approve, while just 41 percent of
Republicans and 55 percent of independents do.
More Findings from the Poll:
•Fear of another terrorist attack has increased since the attempted attack on a Northwest Airlines flight from Amsterdam
on Christmas Day. Now, 26 percent think another attack on the United States within the next few months is very likely, up
from 12 percent just before the latest incident. This is the highest percentage that has felt an attack was very likely since
March 2003, just after the U.S. invasion of Iraq.
•While most Americans (56 percent) have at least a fair amount of confidence that the government will protect its citizens
from future attacks, just 15 percent are very confident. In the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, more expressed confidence.
•Few Americans —just 19 percent - think U.S. intelligence agencies are doing all they could to monitor the actions of
suspected terrorists. Seventy-six think they could be doing more.
•Most Americans support conducting full body scans on travelers using a digital x-ray machine, a device some airports
are now using. Seventy-four percent agree these machines should be used because they provide a detailed check for
hidden weapons and explosives and reduce the need for physical searches. Just 20 percent think these machines should
not be used because they would produce an image of a passenger's naked body and are an invasion of privacy.
•Over half of Americans think the U.S. should continue to keep the Guantanamo Bay prison open. Thirty-two percent
think it ought to be closed and the prisoners there transferred somewhere else.
•The American public continues to volunteer the economy and jobs as the most important problem facing the country (44
percent), with health care a distant second (14 percent). In the wake of the attempted terror attack on Christmas Day, the
percentage that cites terrorism as the most pressing issue has risen to seven percent from zero percent early last month.
•The public's overall assessment of the condition of the national economy remains grim — 82 percent of Americans say
the economy is in bad shape. Looking ahead, 31 percent of Americans think the economy is getting better, while 19
percent think it is getting worse. Forty-nine percent now say the economy is staying the same.","UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05767801 Date: 08/31/2015

Administration should include education assistance in
supplemental funding request for Haiti, Lugar says
Getting Haitian children back in classrooms should be a priority in U.S. assistance to Haiti, U.S.
Sen. Dick Lugar said today after attending the White House Rose Garden ceremony with
President Barack Obama hosting Haitian President René Preval. Earlier in the day, former
President Bill Clinton also told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that this should be a
priority.
""As the Administration prepares to present its supplemental appropriations request for Haiti, a
top priority for recovery and long term reconstruction efforts in Haiti should include significant
assistance to get Haitian children quickly back into the classroom,"" Lugar said. ""Assistance for
infrastructure, technical assistance for instruction and curriculum development especially should
be included. Only with a strong education initiative will Haiti have a chance at a better future.""
Lugar directed two staff members to accompany a Congressional Delegation to Haiti on Friday,
March 5. During the visit, staff saw firsthand the devastation experienced by Haitians and
reported to Lugar that thousands of schools in and around Port au Prince could remain closed for
months or never reopen. As a result, Haitian children could be left languishing in refugee camps.
Before the January 12 earthquake approximately one-half of Haiti's school-age children were
enrolled in classes. Children make up about 45 percent of Haiti's population.
""The relationship between the United States and the Haitian government should be a consensual,
cooperative arrangement that preserves Haitian participation in decisions, while ensuring that the
resources and expertise of the United States Government and international community are
brought to bear on the daily problems of Haiti. Education of the Haiti's youth is an appropriate
starting point,"" Lugar said.

If our early assessment of today's election in Honduras holds, we will have just been witness to a remarkable thing:
Honduran voters have taken back their democracy from two failed leaders -- Zelaya and Micheletti -- who had driven
Honduras to isolation and despair.
The turnout (probably a record) and the clear rejection of the Liberal Party shows our approach was the right one, and
puts Brazil and others who would not recognize the election in an impossible position. As we think about what to say, I
would strongly recommend that we not be shy. We should congratulate the Honduran people, we should connect
today's vote to the deep democratic vocation of the Honduran people, and we should call on the community of
democratic nations (and especially those of the Americas) to recognize, respect, and respond to this accomplishment of
the Honduran people.
Finally, this Administration, which worked so hard to manage and resolve this crisis, should be the one who defines the
results and perceptions of today's vote, and not our critics on the Hill (who had no clear pathway to elections) or our
adversaries in the region (who never wanted this day to happen).

'We're the only ones who believe them'
By: Ben Smith
June 1, 2010 04:44 AM EDT
A delicate diplomatic maneuver by President Barack Obama to smooth frayed relations
with Israel without alienating America's Arab allies may have been blown out of the water
Monday morning by Israel's botched attempt to enforce the Gaza blockade — and by the
lack of condemnation from Washington that followed it.
For while much about the incident remains unclear, a day of carefully parsed statements
from the White House and State Department left at least one irrefutable aftershock: With
much of the world expressing fury over the raid, the contrast with Washington's muted
response could not have been more striking.
""The situation is that they're so isolated right now that it's not only that we're the only ones
who will stick up for them,"" said an American official. ""We're the only ones who believe
them — and what they're saying is true.""
The official was referring to Israeli protestations — backed by Israeli Defense Forces video
— that their solders were attacked by passengers on a ship headed for Gaza with
humanitarian aid, when they boarded the ship in what the Israelis concede were
international waters.
Organizers of the flotilla, meanwhile, insisted that participants were unarmed and that
Israeli forces used excessive force.
The timing of the incident had to be viewed with rueful irony among the administration's
Middle East hands. Obama spent this spring damping down concern among American
friends of Israel that his seeming feud with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had
brought the administration to the verge of fundamentally altering the historic U.S. alliance
with the Jewish state. Obama met personally with Jewish members of Congress and
dispatched top officials to Jewish groups to stress the point, as the ""anti-Bibi"" rhetoric was
simultaneously dialed back precipitously.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05769606 Date: 08/31/2015
The charm offensive appears to have worked. But now an administration that itself has
expressed its own fury toward Netanyahu and his government in the past now finds itself
close to sharing Israel's isolation at the moment — a dynamic that could complicate
Obama's outreach to the rest of the region.
Israel's traditional critics denounced the raid — the chief Palestinian peace negotiator,
Saeb Erakat, called it a ""war crime"" — but so did some the countries Jerusalem counts as
friendly. Turkey's Prime Minister described the incident as an act of ""inhuman state terror""
and Ankara withdrew its ambassador to Israel while the Conservative British Foreign
Secretary took the occasion to call the Gaza blockade ""unacceptable and counter-
productive.""
The White House, in sharp contrast, avoided any hint of criticism of the Israeli action in its
public statements, and American officials appeared sympathetic to Israeli explanations
that their soldiers were attacked by flotilla participants.
The U.S. ""deeply regrets the loss of life and injuries sustained"" in the Israeli raid, deputy
White House press secretary Bill Burton said in the first of three carefully-modulated
statements Monday, The administration, he said, is ""working to understand the
circumstances surrounding this tragedy.""
The White House rendition of a call between Obama and Netanyahu also strained to avoid
condemnation, and went out of the way to note that many of those wounded in the
incident ""are being treated in Israeli hospitals.""
Six hours later, State Department spokesman PJ Crowley issued a third statement, adding
that the U.S. expects that the Israeli government — the unstated emphasis was not the
United Nations — ""will conduct a free and credible investigation.""
Crowley added an evenhanded paragraph calling on the Israelis to open Gaza to
humanitarian aid, while simultaneously condemning the militant group Hamas, whose
political control of Gaza prompted the blockade.
""Hamas' interference with international assistance shipments and work of
nongovernmental organizations, and its use and endorsement of violence, complicates
efforts in Gaza,"" Crowley said.
The immediate upshot of the statements from the United States and other countries is that
Obama, perhaps surprisingly, finds himself in the same posture as his predecessors over
the past 60 years — one that holds that the U.S. is far more willing to give the Israelis the
benefit of the doubt on matters of security.
Washington ""is always going to be the most reluctant major global actor to condemn
Israeli excesses, and that is the position President Obama finds himself in right now,"" said
Hussein Ibish, a Senior Fellow at The American Task Force on Palestine.
That position squares with the administration's apparent, reluctant rapprochement with
Israeli's rightist leader — even if that burying of grudges had deep reverberations for the
peace process.

""After wandering around for 15 months, vacillating between pandering to the Israelis and
trying o punish them, they have decided they have to work out some kind of relationship
with Netanyahu that allows them to do something serious,"" said Aaron David Miller, a
former American peace negotiator. ""They need to weather this crisis with the relationship
with the Israelis north of where it is now.""
The most immediate challenge, Miller said, will be steering a special session of the UN
Security Council — called by Arab members — away from forcing the U.S. either to vote on
condemning Israel's actions or to veto a resolution condemning them.
Observers of the process expect the U.S. to attempt to craft a resolution that doesn't
condemn Israeli directly and doesn't establish any international investigation, like an
earlier inquiry into Israel's actions in Gaza led by the former South African Judge Richard
Goldstone.
Obama and other American officials stressed the need to study the details of the incident,
as the Israeli government pointed to video of passengers on the ship — which was boarded
in international waters — attacking Israeli commandos with what appeared to be chairs and
metal poles.
""At this point, it is unclear what happened and there must be a thorough investigation,""
Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman John Kerry said in a statement.
Others suggested that further probes may not change the initial reactions. ""You can have
an independent commission spend 3 or 4 months studying this thing and come out with
something that is stunningly clear and factual, but it doesn't matter,"" said Miller. ""People
knew where they were before this episode started.""

Taking On China
By PAUL KRUGMAN
Tensions are rising over Chinese economic policy, and rightly so: China's policy of keeping its currency, the renminbi,
undervalued has become a significant drag on global economic recovery. Something must be done.
To give you a sense of the problem: Widespread complaints that China was manipulating its currency — selling renminbi
and buying foreign currencies, so as to keep the renminbi weak and China's exports artificially competitive — began
around 2003. At that point China was adding about $10 billion a month to its reserves, and in 2003 it ran an overall
surplus on its current account — a broad measure of the trade balance — of $46 billion.
Today, China is adding more than $30 billion a month to its $2.4 trillion hoard of reserves. The International Monetary
Fund expects China to have a 2010 current surplus of more than $450 billion — 10 times the 2003 figure. This is the most
distortionary exchange rate policy any major nation has ever followed.
And it's a policy that seriously damages the rest of the world. Most of the world's large economies are stuck in a liquidity
trap — deeply depressed, but unable to generate a recovery by cutting interest rates because the relevant rates are
already near zero. China, by engineering an unwarranted trade surplus, is in effect imposing an anti-stimulus on these
economies, which they can't offset.
So how should we respond? First of all, the U.S. Treasury Department must stop fudging and obfuscating.
Twice a year, by law, Treasury must issue a report identifying nations that ""manipulate the rate of exchange between their
currency and the United States dollar for purposes of preventing effective balance of payments adjustments or gaining
unfair competitive advantage in international trade."" The law's intent is clear: the report should be a factual determination,
not a policy statement. In practice, however, Treasury has been both unwilling to take action on the renminbi and unwilling
to do what the law requires, namely explain to Congress why it isn't taking action. Instead, it has spent the past six or
seven years pretending not to see the obvious.
Will the next report, due April 15, continue this tradition? Stay tuned.
If Treasury does find Chinese currency manipulation, then what? Here, we have to get past a common misunderstanding:
the view that the Chinese have us over a barrel, because we don't dare provoke China into dumping its dollar assets.
What you have to ask is, What would happen if China tried to sell a large share of its U.S. assets? Would interest rates
soar? Short-term U.S. interest rates wouldn't change: they're being kept near zero by the Fed, which won't raise rates
until the unemployment rate comes down. Long-term rates might rise slightly, but they're mainly determined by market
expectations of future short-term rates. Also, the Fed could offset any interest-rate impact of a Chinese pullback by
expanding its own purchases of long-term bonds.
It's true that if China dumped its U.S. assets the value of the dollar would fall against other major currencies, such as the
euro. But that would be a good thing for the United States, since it would make our goods more competitive and reduce
our trade deficit. On the other hand, it would be a bad thing for China, which would suffer large losses on its dollar
holdings. In short, right now America has China over a barrel, not the other way around.
So we have no reason to fear China. But what should we do?
Some still argue that we must reason gently with China, not confront it. But we've been reasoning with China for years, as
its surplus ballooned, and gotten nowhere: on Sunday Wen Jiabao, the Chinese prime minister, declared — absurdly —
that his nation's currency is not undervalued. (The Peterson Institute for International Economics estimates that the
renminbi is undervalued by between 20 and 40 percent.) And Mr. Wen accused other nations of doing what China actually
does, seeking to weaken their currencies ""just for the purposes of increasing their own exports.""
But if sweet reason won't work, what's the alternative? In 1971 the United States dealt with a similar but much less severe
problem of foreign undervaluation by imposing a temporary 10 percent surcharge on imports, which was removed a few
months later after Germany, Japan and other nations raised the dollar value of their currencies. At this point, it's hard to
see China changing its policies unless faced with the threat of similar action — except that this time the surcharge would
have to be much larger, say 25 percent.
I don't propose this turn to policy hardball lightly. But Chinese currency policy is adding materially to the world's economic
problems at a time when those problems are already very severe. It's time to take a stand.

Taking On China
By PAUL KRUGMAN
Tensions are rising over Chinese economic policy, and rightly so: China's policy of keeping its currency, the renminbi,
undervalued has become a significant drag on global economic recovery. Something must be done.
To give you a sense of the problem: Widespread complaints that China was manipulating its currency — selling renminbi
and buying foreign currencies, so as to keep the renminbi weak and China's exports artificially competitive — began
around 2003. At that point China was adding about $10 billion a month to its reserves, and in 2003 it ran an overall
surplus on its current account — a broad measure of the trade balance — of $46 billion.
Today, China is adding more than $30 billion a month to its $2.4 trillion hoard of reserves. The International Monetary
Fund expects China to have a 2010 current surplus of more than $450 billion — 10 times the 2003 figure. This is the most
distortionary exchange rate policy any major nation has ever followed.
And it's a policy that seriously damages the rest of the world. Most of the world's large economies are stuck in a liquidity
trap — deeply depressed, but unable to generate a recovery by cutting interest rates because the relevant rates are
already near zero. China, by engineering an unwarranted trade surplus, is in effect imposing an anti-stimulus on these
economies, which they can't offset.
So how should we respond? First of all, the U.S. Treasury Department must stop fudging and obfuscating.
Twice a year, by law, Treasury must issue a report identifying nations that ""manipulate the rate of exchange between their
currency and the United States dollar for purposes of preventing effective balance of payments adjustments or gaining
unfair competitive advantage in international trade."" The law's intent is clear: the report should be a factual determination,
not a policy statement. In practice, however, Treasury has been both unwilling to take action on the renminbi and unwilling
to do what the law requires, namely explain to Congress why it isn't taking action. Instead, it has spent the past six or
seven years pretending not to see the obvious.
Will the next report, due April 15, continue this tradition? Stay tuned.
If Treasury does find Chinese currency manipulation, then what? Here, we have to get past a common misunderstanding:
the view that the Chinese have us over a barrel, because we don't dare provoke China into dumping its dollar assets.

You'll see that the Secretary's points for Ashton mention the idea of our sending an inter-agency expert team
to Brussels for the next few months to improve US-EU coordination on Iran sanctions prep. EU officials had
been receptive, but now the bureaucrats are saying this would be ""counter-productive"", and instead prefer
more regular videoconferences. Which is probably OK. Anyway, I just wanted you to know the background, in

Aluf Benn / Netanyahu leaves U.S. disgraced, isolated and weaker
By Ake Berm
Details emerging from Benjamin Netanyahu's visit to Washington remain incomplete, but the conclusion may nonetheless
be drawn that the prime minister erred in choosing to fly to the United States this week. The visit - touted as a fence-
mending effort, a bid to strengthen the tenuous ties between Netanyahu and U.S. President Barack Obama - only
highlighted the deep rift between the American and Israeli administrations.
The prime minister leaves America disgraced, isolated, and altogether weaker than when he came.
Instead of setting the diplomatic agenda, Netanyahu surrendered control over it. Instead of leaving the Palestinian issue
aside and focusing on Iran, as he would like, Netanyahu now finds himself fighting for the legitimacy of Israeli control over
East Jerusalem.
Advertisement
The most sensitive and insoluble core issues - those which when raised a decade ago led to the dissolution of
the peace process and explosion of the second intifada - are now being served as a mere appetizer.
At the start of his visit, Netanyahu was tempted to bask in the warm welcome he received at the AIPAC conference, at
which he gave his emotional address on Jerusalem.
Taking a page from Menachem Begin, he spoke not on behalf of the State of Israel, but in the name of the Jewish people
itself and its millennia of history.
His speech was not radical rightist rhetoric. Reading between the lines, one could spot a certain willingness to relinquish
West Bank settlements as long as Israel maintains a security buffer in the Jordan Valley.
But at the White House, the prime minister's speech to thousands of pro-Israel activists and hundreds of cheering
congressmen looked like an obvious attempt to raise political capital against the American president.
Knowing Netanyahu would be reenergized by his speech at the lobby, Obama and his staff set him a honey trap. Over the
weekend they sought to quell the row that flared up during U.S. Vice President Joe Biden's trip here two weeks ago, and
U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton described Netanyahu's response to the ultimatums Washington presented to him
as ""useful.""
Special envoy George Mitchell made a televised visit to the prime minister's bureau Sunday to invite Netanyahu to the
White House. Washington, it seemed, was trying to make nice.
Far from it. Just when Netanyahu thought he had resolved the crisis by apologizing to Biden, Clinton called him up for a
dressing down.
This time as well, Netanyahu almost believed the crisis had passed, that he had survived by offering partial. noncommittal
answers to the Americans' questions. Shortly before meeting with Obama, Netanyahu even warned the Palestinians that
should they continue to demand a freeze on construction, he would postpone peace talks by a year.
His arrogant tone underscored the fact that Netanyahu believed that on the strength of his AIPAC speech, he could call
the next few steps of the diplomatic dance.
But then calamity struck. At their White House meeting, Obama made clear to his guest that the letter Netanyahu had
sent was insufficient and returned it for further corrections. Instead of a reception as a guest of honor, Netanyahu was
treated as a problem child, an army private ordered to do laps around the base for slipping up at roll call.
The revolution in the Americans' behavior is clear to all. On Sunday morning Obama was still anxiously looking ahead to
the House of Representatives vote on health care - the last thing he wanted was a last-minute disagreement with
congressmen over ties with Israel.
The moment the bill was passed, however, a victorious Obama was free to deal with his unruly guest.
The Americans made every effort to downplay the visit. As during his last visit in November, Netanyahu was invited to the
White House at a late hour, without media coverage or a press conference. If that were not enough, the White House
spokesman challenged Netanyahu's observation at AIPAC that ""Jerusalem is not a settlement.""
The Americans didn't even wait for him to leave Washington to make their disagreement known. It was not the behavior
Washington shows an ally, but the kind it shows an annoyance.
The approval of construction at the Shepherd Hotel in Sheikh Jarrah, announced before his meeting with Obama, again
caught Netanyahu unawares. Apparently the special panel appointed after the Ramat Shlomo debacle to prevent such
surprises failed its first test.
Netanyahu is having his most difficult week since returning to office, beginning with the unfortunate decision to relocate
the planned emergency room at Ashkelon's Barzilai Medical Center and lasting through his humiliating jaunt through
Washington.
Returning to Israel today, Netanyahu will need to work hard to rehabilitate his image, knowing full well that Obama will not
relent, but instead demand that he stop zigzagging and decide, once and for all, whether he stands with America or with
the settlers.","UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05768882 Date: 08/31/2015

Speaking too softly
Feb 15th 2010 I NEW YORK

Relations between America and China may chill over a meeting with the Dalai Lama
AP
IT IS bound to be a controversial meeting. The Dalai Lama, Tibet's spiritual leader, goes to Washington,
DC, this week and will sit down with President Barack Obanna for the first time on Thursday February 18th.
American presidents have long been happy to meet the Tibetan leader and to tolerate subsequent angry
huffing from China, not least as a means of responding to public concern over human rights without doing
anything serious to jeopardise trade or other ties with Beijing.
But in Mr Obama's case, with China increasingly assertive internationally and the American president
perceived in many quarters as cautious, even timid, in foreign policy, the encounter with the Dalai Lama
has assumed extra significance. Mr Obama will be studied closely. Human-rights activists will listen with
care to the language that the American president uses, straining to hear whether he goes further than
merely suggesting more dialogue between Tibetans and the Chinese leadership. Might the president dare
to deliver real criticism of repression and human-rights abuses in Tibet?
Kenneth Roth, the head of Human Rights Watch, an activist group in New York, offers a mixed assessment
of Mr Obama's foreign policy so far in its treatment of human rights. He suggests that no other recent
American leader has taken such care with his rhetoric, judging how it is received by the rest of the world.
But substantial steps too rarely follow Mr Obama's fine words. The president's speeches—as in Cairo last
year—have helped to set a conciliatory tone for American foreign policy, and to reassure Muslims and
ntharc that Amprira ic nnt riptprminpri to copk rnnfrontatinn for thP caIcP of it Thniinhtfill cnrnmPntc to

African leaders, urging the continent to develop strong and democratic institutions, have also been well
received. But Mr Roth sees little evidence of a leader who is prepared then to press reluctant regimes, as
for example did Ronald Reagan (and before him, Jimmy Carter) in pushing the Soviet Union to sign up to
an international commitment, the Helsinki Final Act, which promoted individual rights.
Mr Obama's foreign-policy approach of seeking engagement with opponents such as Iran, in an effort to
establish dialogue and more effective diplomatic channels, has made it harder for him to beat the human-
rights drum loudly. But by failing to speak up about repression, the American leader risks being perceived
as weak. His muted reaction to the rigged presidential elections in Iran and the violent repression that
followed (and continues) has seemed deferential. His eagerness to ""reset"" relations with Russia, for
example by scrapping a planned anti-missile defence shield in eastern Europe, has coincided with near
total silence over the murders of journalists and the clamping down on democracy in that country. It is
unclear, in either case, that biting his tongue has brought any gains from the respective regimes.
Particularly troubling has been America's attitude to China and human rights. After Hillary Clinton's first
visit to China as secretary of state, in February 2009, she announced that concern over human rights
should not ""interfere"" with getting co-operation on other issues such as climate change and the global
economy. Human-rights defenders were deflated. Mr Obama then avoided meeting the Dalai Lama when
he visited America in September and postponed a scheduled meeting in October, to avoid upsetting the
government in China ahead of a presidential visit. During Mr Obama's subsequent visit to China, he made
few and limited comments on human rights. The Chinese government responded by becoming more
assertive. It helped to scupper a deal at the Copenhagen summit on climate change in December and
snubbed the American president by sending a deputy minister to a crucial meeting. China has generally
proven to be increasingly unwilling to co-operate with America, for example over United Nations sanctions
against Iran.
The administration, however, may now be toughening up. American rhetoric over Iran has become firmer.
On Monday Mrs Clinton warned that a military dictatorship was emerging in Tehran. Relations with China,
too, have become frostier, for example over a long-planned (and routine) decision by the American
government to sell weapons to Taiwan. Mrs Clinton has also spoken up more forcefully about the need for
internet freedom in China, in the wake of sophisticated cyber-attacks on Google that many believe had
Chinese government fingerprints on them. This week's meeting with the Dalai Lama is thus a moment to
demonstrate that Mr Obama is ready both to signal his concern for human rights and that his foreign-
policy is becoming more assertive.

I noticed on your schedule that you are meeting with a number of tech CEO's this evening. Google should be an obvious
co-sponsor of the USA Pavilion and they have consistently pushed us off. Although they bring up IP issues as a reason
not to participate, the Chinese frequently note that they do a lot of business in China. We are now at $54 million. If the
opportunity arises, it would be helpful to note the importance of a USA standing in Shanghai.

Paul Simons called me shortly after earthquake hit Chile (8.5 Richter-- stronger than Haiti). He was going to reach out to
advance team. Marriott Hotel fine. Event frightening because of intensity of tremor. Epicenter near Concepcion-- third
largest city in Chile about 400 miles south of Santiago (city of Cauquenes--- hardest hit).
Just heard Bachelet on TV-- casualties so far 16-- though because communications down and it is still dark information is
preliminary. Some concern over risk of Tsunami though Navy deems unlikely. Fortunately, there is no collapse of dams.
Considerable damage to highway bridges and infrastructure--that will affect traffic-- in Talca hospital evacuated for
precautionary reasons. President declared zones of Maule and Bio Bio disaster areas.
Significant loss of life and damage unlikely because Chile suffered devastating earthquakes in 1939 and 1960 (the
strongest in recorded history) in same area so most old construction is gone. Chile has strong construction codes and
state of the art anti-earthquake standards. Also Chile has excellent first responder capacity. One concern of course are
aftershocks. In 1960 (May 21) a second earthquake occurred day after that caused a Tsunami in Japan.
Will have to evaluate whether trip to Chile should proceed. Precisely because of tragedy this may not be time to cancel -
- provided Chilean side can handle and are anxious for trip to proceed. Suspect that that will be the case. Should
evaluate in morning after dust settles.

Rashad Hussain, a Muslim and new U.S. envoy, is bridge between two
worlds
By Scott Wilson
Monday, March 1, 2010; A19
Rashad Hussain, President Obama's new special envoy to the Organization of the Islamic Conference, was an
avid high school debater in Plano, Tex., where he grew up.
His debate partner and best friend was a classmate named Josh Goldberg, meaning that at the end of many
tournaments, the judge would announce ""Goldberg-Hussain"" as the cultural odd couple who had won the
argument. ""People got a kick out of it,"" Hussain said in a recent interview. ""We joked that one day we would
have the solution to the peace process."" The two remain close friends.
In his new position, Hussain, who is both a Koran scholar and an ardent North Carolina Tar Heels basketball
fan, will be responsible for helping to bridge another cultural divide -- the one in U.S. relations with Muslims
inside and outside the nation's borders.
Since taking office, Obama has adopted an approach to broaden the ways in which the United States engages
the Islamic world, moving from a policy focused mostly on counterterrorism to one that includes partnerships
with Muslim countries and communities in education, health, science and commerce.
Hussain, 31, will be the face of that policy in Jiddah, Saudi Arabia, where the Islamic Conference has it
headquarters, and in the other capitals of its 56 member countries. His is an appropriately young face for an
American representative to the world's 1.6 billion Muslims, the majority of whom are younger than he is.
At a time when the United States is fighting two wars in Muslim nations and defending itself against an
enduring terrorist threat, changing perceptions will take time. ""The challenge is to continue to communicate that
this is a long-term process,"" Hussain said. ""Sometimes the challenge becomes that people want to focus
exclusively on the political issues, issues that this administration is working very diligently to solve.""
Hussain's father, a mining engineer, moved from Bihar, India, to Wyoming in the late 1960s. A few years later,
during a visit to India, he married Hussain's mother, now an obstetrician in Plano.

The family prayed regularly in a mosque not far from the church-heavy city. At about the time he began middle
school, the Persian Gulf War began and, as he recalled, ""it was not the easiest time to be named Hussain."" But
he said he encountered very little religious persecution during a childhood that featured study, prayer and
basketball -- a passion he shares with the president. Hussain said it is his ""dream"" to play in one of Obama's
pickup games.
He graduated from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, then enrolled at Harvard University to
pursue a master's degree in Arabic and Islamic studies. An internship after his first year of graduate school with
Rep. Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.) cemented his interest in government, and he returned after completing his
degree to work on the House Judiciary Committee and was there on the morning of the attacks of Sept. 11,
2001.
""I experienced firsthand being evacuated from the building, not knowing what was going on, seeing the twin
towers burning on TV as soon as I got into work, not knowing . . . whether there was a plane heading for the
Capitol,"" he said. ""I very much experienced the terror on that day myself.""
In the following days, he said, he experienced a ""whole set of feelings,"" from the initial fear of attack to worry
about discrimination against American Muslims. He said he found that compassion, broader than the pockets of
persecution, is often overlooked by Muslims here and abroad.
""A lot is made about American misperceptions about Muslim communities, but there's a lot of misperceptions
that Muslim communities have about the United States,"" he said. To counter such misunderstandings of Muslim
culture, Hussain cited his wife, whom he said ""breaks down a lot of the misperceptions of women in Islam."" Isra
Bhatty, a Yale Law School student currently on a Rhodes scholarship, wears the hijab and is an epic Chicago
Bears fan.
Hussain left Capitol Hill to attend Yale Law School. While there, he criticized the trial of Sami al-Arian, a
University of South Florida professor, as ""politically motivated persecution."" Arian was accused of aiding the
Palestinian Islamic Jihad movement, a U.S.-designated terrorist organization. Hussain, who did not criticize the
charges against Arian, was on a civil liberties panel with Arian's daughter when he made the comment. A jury
acquitted Arian on some charges and deadlocked on others; he eventually pleaded guilty to one count of
conspiracy.
""My extensive writings on this topic make it clear that I condemn terrorism unequivocally in all its forms,""
Hussain said. ""I'd be happy to put that against one sentence from 2004 that I believe was taken out of context.""
After the 2008 election, Hussain was recruited to the White House counsel's office by Cassandra Butts, a fellow
Tar Heel and Obama's former Harvard Law classmate. He has worked there on national security and new-media
issues and helped inform the administration's Muslim outreach efforts.
Ben Rhodes, Obama's chief foreign policy speechwriter, sought Hussain's counsel last year as he drafted the
president's Cairo address. Hussain said his advice concerned the contributions Muslims have made to American
society and the context behind some of the religious passages. Hussain has memorized the Koran. He prays
daily, often in a room in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building reserved for all faiths.
Hussain traveled in the Middle East after Obama announced his appointment during a Feb. 13 videoconference
at the U.S.-Islamic World Forum in Doha, Qatar. His approach, Hussain said, will be to emphasize to Muslim
countries what ""America stands for,"" including through the partnerships.
""It's clear that we're not going to agree on every single issue,"" Hussain said. ""Our job will be to try to maximize
our areas of agreement and work through our areas of disagreement and come to the best policy.""

U.S. Revises Tack on Mideast Arms
Washington, Egypt Discuss Plan to Rid Region of Nuclear Weapons, in Effort to Steal Iran's Thunder at U.N. Conference
By JONATHAN WEISMAN, JAY SOLOMON and JOE LAURIA
The U.S. is negotiating with Egypt a proposal to make the Middle East a region free of nuclear weapons, as the U.S. seeks
to prevent Iran from derailing a monthlong U.N. conference on nuclear nonproliferation that begins Monday.
U.S. officials familiar with the move call it an important step in assuring countries that Washington—criticized by some
for its silence about Israel's undeclared nuclear arsenal—will equitably address weapons proliferation across the region, as
Iran seeks to shift focus away from its own nuclear program.
Washington also reassured Israel it won't foist a nuclear-free zone on the region until all parties agree to it and significant
progress has been made on Mideast peace.
The U.N. conference on the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which is held every five years, is expected to begin with a
bang Monday with an address by Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who has condemned the West for its refusal
to disarm and for tacitly accepting Israel's nuclear capability.
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton will follow the Iranian leader in the afternoon.
The U.N. talks come at a time when Iran is believed to be heading toward a nuclear capability and the U.S. and allies have
been pressing for new, tough Security Council sanctions to curb Tehran's program.
""The Iranians are clearly intending to spoil the party,"" said a senior U.S. official involved in the nuclear diplomacy. The
official highlighted the importance of raising Mideast nuclear-free zone issues.
The designation of the region as a zone free of weapons of mass destruction was a nonbinding agreement that emerged
from a 1995 U.N. review of the Non-Proliferation Treaty, a 1970 pact to limit the spread of nuclear weapons. That 1995
agreement was pivotal because it won the indefinite extension of the treaty, but no action on the zone has been taken
since.
Senior Obama administration officials said Friday the White House is willing to significantly advance a Mideast nuclear
weapons-free zone, and would support a conference on the subject at a future date. U.S. officials said talks with Egypt
would resume in New York in the coming month. Such a zone is envisaged to include Israel, the Arab states, Iran and
Turkey.
""We've made a proposal to them [Egypt] that goes beyond what the U.S. has been willing to do before,"" said the senior
U.S. official involved in the nuclear diplomacy.
U.S. officials stressed, however, that they didn't believe that would happen without first achieving major advances in
Arab-Israeli peace talks.
""We are concerned that the conditions are not right unless all members of the region participate, which would be unlikely
unless there is a comprehensive peace plan which is accepted,"" said Ellen Tauscher, undersecretary of state for arms
control and international security. She said the U.S. has also discussed the zone with the Arab League and other members
of the Nonaligned Movement.
The diplomacy could raise new tensions between President Barack Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu if Washington is seen backing away from its commitment to Israel. Israel has voiced concerns that the U.N.
conference could turn into an international forum to corner Israel. Mr. Netanyahu backed out of a nuclear-security
conference in Washington in March due to such concerns.
An Israeli official said Friday that his government supports a Middle East freeze of WMD and nuclear weapons, but that
""it should be the culmination of a process that begins with bilateral and individual peace agreements between all the
countries in the region.""
The U.S. and Israel have been locked in a monthslong spat over Mr. Obama's calls for a complete freeze in building new
Jewish housing in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. U.S. officials have grown increasingly confident in recent days that
ties between the U.S. and Israel have stabilized. Mrs. Clinton said Friday that the Mideast peace process will get on track
next week, though not the U.S.-brokered direct talks involving Israeli and Palestinians that the Obama administration
wants to see.
Egypt's latest proposal calls for Israel's disarmament ""as soon as possible."" It also called for Israel's nuclear program to be
placed under the auspices of the International Atomic Energy Agency, the U.N.'s atomic watchdog. That proposal won't
be accepted, U.S. officials said.
The Egyptian working paper demands NPT signatory states release ""all information available to them on the nature and
scope of Israeli nuclear facilities and activities, including information pertaining to previous nuclear transfers to Israel.""
U.S. officials indicated no such demands could be made on Israel.
Arms-control analysts familiar with the talks say the U.S. is likely to propose creating a U.N. envoy given the task of
calling a conference of Middle East nations to press forward on the nuclear weapon-free zone.
""They are desperate to buy off Egyptian objections,"" said Henry Sokolski, executive director of the Non-Proliferation
Education Center and a critic of the Obama administration's arms-control approach.
Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association, an advocacy group, said the U.S. acceptance of a
special envoy is a significant shift. A U.S. official refused to say whether the envoy proposal, first floated by Russia, was
part of the U.S. offer.
The last NPT conference in 2005 ended in collapse. But U.S. officials said they have been laying the groundwork for this
conference for nearly a year.
The White House wants rules to ensure that a country that withdraws from the treaty doesn't escape inspections and
sanctions. They also want more power for U.N. inspectors and more backing for multinational facilities that could help
nations develop peaceful nuclear power.

Hi Hillary,
B6
Just wanted to let you know that the ARC did give a $10 million grant (reduced to $3.8 because of political reasons) - but
it almost didn't get accepted by the Haitians because they didn't want oversight. But with Paul Farmer's help we
created a joint oversight process with PIH, KPMG and the Ministry of Health. Sadly its slow going. But my cousin at the
ARC is working to do the right things.... Any good words you can say about the ARC would be appreciated!
And we are trying to move things forward still...
As always, fondly,
Mark

Google's announcement on their blog:
A new approach to China
1/12/2010 03:00:00 PM
Like many other well-known organizations, we face cyber attacks of varying degrees on a regular
basis. In mid-December, we detected a highly sophisticated and targeted attack on our corporate
infrastructure originating from China that resulted in the theft of intellectual property from Google.
However, it soon became clear that what at first appeared to be solely a security incident--albeit a
significant one--was something quite different.
First, this attack was not just on Google. As part of our investigation we have discovered that at least
twenty other large companies from a wide range of businesses--including the Internet, finance,
technology, media and chemical sectors--have been similarly targeted. We are currently in the
process of notifying those companies, and we are also working with the relevant U.S. authorities.
Second, we have evidence to suggest that a primary goal of the attackers was accessing the Gmail
accounts of Chinese human rights activists. Based on our investigation to date we believe their attack
did not achieve that objective. Only two Gmail accounts appear to have been accessed, and that
activity was limited to account information (such as the date the account was created) and subject
line, rather than the content of emails themselves.
Third, as part of this investigation but independent of the attack on Google, we have discovered that
the accounts of dozens of U.S.-, China- and Europe-based Gmail users who are advocates of human
rights in China appear to have been routinely accessed by third parties. These accounts have not
been accessed through any security breach at Google, but most likely via phishing scams or malware
placed on the users' computers.
We have already used information gained from this attack to make infrastructure and architectural
improvements that enhance security for Google and for our users. In terms of individual users, we
would advise people to deploy reputable anti-virus and anti-spyware programs on their computers, to
install patches for their operating systems and to update their web browsers. Always be cautious
when clicking on links appearing in instant messages and emails, or when asked to share personal
information like passwords online. You can read more here about our cyber-security

recommendations. People wanting to learn more about these kinds of attacks can read this U.S.
government report (PDF), Nart Villeneuve's bloq and this presentation on the GhostNet spying
incident.
We have taken the unusual step of sharing information about these attacks with a broad audience not
just because of the security and human rights implications of what we have unearthed, but also
because this information goes to the heart of a much bigger global debate about freedom of speech.
In the last two decades, China's economic reform programs and its citizens' entrepreneurial flair have
lifted hundreds of millions of Chinese people out of poverty. Indeed, this great nation is at the heart of
much economic progress and development in the world today.
We launched Google.cn in January 2006 in the belief that the benefits of increased access to
information for people in China and a more open Internet outweighed our discomfort in agreeing to
censor some results. At the time we made clear that ""we will carefully monitor conditions in China,
including new laws and other restrictions on our services. If we determine that we are unable to
achieve the objectives outlined we will not hesitate to reconsider our approach to China.""
These attacks and the surveillance they have uncovered--combined with the attempts over the past
year to further limit free speech on the web--have led us to conclude that we should review the
feasibility of our business operations in China. We have decided we are no longer willing to continue
censoring our results on Google.cn, and so over the next few weeks we will be discussing with the
Chinese government the basis on which we could operate an unfiltered search engine within the law,
if at all. We recognize that this may well mean having to shut down Google.cn, and potentially our
offices in China.
The decision to review our business operations in China has been incredibly hard, and we know that
it will have potentially far-reaching consequences. We want to make clear that this move was driven
by our executives in the United States, without the knowledge or involvement of our employees in
China who have worked incredibly hard to make Google.cn the success it is today. We are committed
to working responsibly to resolve the very difficult issues raised.

Huma, I wanted to relay to you the sincere sentiments of appreciation expressed by the PM's Office and the MFA for the
very personal touch by the Secretary notifying the PM about postponement of the trip. Not lost on the GPNG is the fact
that the entire trip was postponed, not the PNG portion. As you can imagine that is politically very significant.
Naturally, we stand ready to reconstitute the program or enhance it should the trip move forward at a later date. We
got luck today w/the weather—not a rain cloud in sight.
Safe travels, and hopefully we will work together at a later date. Best of luck with the Haiti recovery effort!

Northern Ireland agrees power-sharing deal
Gordon Brown hails historic deal which will see justice and policing powers be devolved to Stormont from 12 April

Justice and policing powers will be devolved to Northern Ireland <http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/northernireland> 's
power-sharing government from 12 April in a historic deal agreed by the main parties that ""opens a new chapter"" after
decades of violence, Gordon Brown said today.
Standing alongside his Irish counterpart, Brian Cowen, at a press conference at Hillsborough Castle outside Belfast, the
prime minister said the ""inspirational"" agreement between Sinn Fein <http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/sinn-fein>
and the Democratic Unionist party (DUP) <http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/dup> was a foundation for lasting peace.
The deal —finally agreed to by the DUP <http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2010/feb/05/northern-ireland-dup-ulster-
deal> last night and described as a final piece in the jigsaw after a long search for peace — comes after two weeks of
round-the-clock negotiations and brings an end to fears that the power-sharing government might collapse.
It will see policing and justice powers devolved from Westminster to the assembly within weeks and includes new plans
on overseeing parades.
Brown, who travelled to Belfast this morning, said the agreement had been possible because of ""a new spirit of mutual
co-operation and respect"".
The deal meets a key Sinn Fein demand and prevents the republican party from walking out of the power-sharing
executive. In return, the DUP has secured reforms to the way loyalist marches are handled in Northern Ireland, including
the abolition of the Parades Commission, a body most unionists regard as biased in favour of nationalists.
A cross-community vote will now be held in the Stormont assembly on 9 March before the policing and justice powers
are devolved from London on 12 April.
Brown told reporters: ""The achievements have been as great as they are inspirational. This moment and this agreement
belongs to the people of Northern Ireland, all of the people, and now more than ever before so does their future ... This
is the last chapter of a long and troubled story and the beginning of a new chapter after decades of violence, years of
talks, weeks of stalemate.""
Cowen praised both unionists and nationalists for making ""fair and balanced compromises"" to bridge the divisions and
said the quality of the negotiations meant that the ""devolved institutions can and will work"".
The Northern Ireland secretary, Shaun Woodward, said the deal would further isolate republican dissidents who have
launched three separate gun and bomb attacks against police stations in the province over the last 10 days. The deal
would ""absolutely"" make Northern Ireland a safer place, he said.
The DUP leader, Peter Robinson, said the agreement ""will be more enduring because of the time spent"" in forming it.

Referring back to the Belfast Agreement of 1998 <http://www.nio.gov.uk/the-agreement> when negotiations bore fruit
at the 11th hour, the Sinn Fein president, Gerry Adams, described the current deal and the rescue of power-sharing as
""yet another very good Friday"".
Jeffrey Donaldson told the Guardian the DUP's 36-strong assembly team was now unanimously in favour of the deal.
But the Ulster Unionist party (UUP) has yet to officially back the package which will allow the assembly to set up
legislation to change the way parades are judged.
A UUP spokeswoman said members wanted to see the proposed agreement before giving their response to the two
governments. ""We have not had sight of this agreement and until we do we will not be signing up to it,"" she said.
The talks, which centred on Hillsborough Castle, outside Belfast, are the longest set of continuous negotiations held in
the near 20-year peace process. Sinn Fein had accused the DUP of stalling on the transfer of policing powers for the last
three years and it was feared that failure to find agreement could see the collapse of the power-sharing government led
by the two parties.
The agreement finally came near midnight at Stormont's parliament building. Earlier in the evening Sinn Fein had said
the basis of a deal was on the table and it was giving the DUP leadership the time to persuade its party to accept it.
Robinson emerged from a meeting of party colleagues to confirm that he had secured unanimous support for the
proposals. Earlier in the week up to 14 DUP assembly members had opposed a proposed deal because it did not give
unionists enough concessions.
Robinson said he would now look to gain the support of the community and the smaller assembly parties for the deal.
""We have a basis upon which we can go forward and recommend it [the deal] to our party, to the other parties in
Northern Ireland and to the community.
""An essential element of the Democratic Unionist Party's manifesto is the requirement for community confidence; we
believe this can be the basis for gaining that confidence.""
However the leader of the hardline Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV), Jim Allister, questioned why the 14 DUP rebels had
changed their minds.
""The deal hasn't changed, only the snowmen of the DUP, who melted once the heat came on,"" Allister said.
The DUP now faces a struggle to ward off the TUV threat in the forthcoming general election. Allister will portray the
deal as a sell-out of unionist principles and a sop to republicanism.

Cheryl,
As of this hour of Thursday night there is no deal on an ironclad, substantive, political platform of national solidarity and
governance reform, in return for Abdullah's gracious concession which would obviate the constitutional and political
need for a problematic 2nd round.
Karl and I remain in close touch with the candidates as they continue their engagement. But short of a miracle, there
will be no such deal at least until Friday evening or Saturday morning, if then.
Hence, as we understand the exigencies of our Boss's travel sked, it appears to be time to pull the plug: we won't be
recommending before our Friday evening that she make a stop in Kabul on Saturday. The default remains: no Kabul
stop.
Nonetheless, Abdullah has now set Saturday as the date for his address to the nation, and Karzai clearly wants both for
him to concede, and to attract a visit of the Secretary. The best scenario would have been an announcement in the
presence of the Secretary, as a trusted witness to whom the parties would be more or less politically accountable. If we
get happy news by Saturday morning and the Boss can't come then, or perhaps a day or two later on route home from
the ME, then we'll likely be recommending that she again phone each of the two protagonists, followed by a positive
public statement.

New blow for Tories as lead slips in marginals
By Nigel Morris and Michael Savage
Poll shows crumbling support in target seats as David
Cameron is drawn into Ashcroft non-dom row
The Conservative lead is crumbling in the crucial marginal seats that David Cameron is relying on to deliver general
election victory for the party, a poll last night disclosed.
The result was a fresh setback for the Tory leader after a torrid day in which he was drawn deeper into the row over the
billionaire peer Lord Ashcroft, when it emerged that he had known for less than a month that Lord Ashcroft had
maintained his non-dom tax status for 10 years.
The chances of the party drawing a line under the controversy were also wrecked by the announcement that Lord
Ashcroft will be summoned to the Commons to explain why he negotiated a secret deal to enter the House of Lords
without paying tax in this country on his overseas fortune.
With Gordon Brown expected to announce the election date this month, senior Tories have put a brave face on their
sliding support in national opinion polls since the turn of the year.
They insisted they were performing much more strongly in marginal constituencies where the drive for votes has been
masterminded and substantially funded by Lord Ashcroft.
The YouGov poll for Channel 4 News found the Tory lead in 60 Labour-held marginals had shrunk from seven to just two
points over the past year.
The slide in Conservative support is further evidence Britain could be heading for a hung parliament after the election
expected on 6 May. The survey put the Tories on 39 per cent (down four points since last year) and Labour on 37 per cent
(up one). YouGov calculated that the results would leave the Tories the largest party after the election, but 11 seats short
of an overall Commons majority.
An investigation by The Independent last week found the Tories spent £6m over two years in the marginal battlegrounds,
in most cases far outspending Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
The party faces the daunting challenge of capturing 117 seats to achieve a majority of just one - a task described by a
shadow cabinet member as a ""mountain to climb"".
The Conservatives received some good news yesterday when an 18-month inquiry by the Electoral Commission
concluded that the £5.1m they received in donations from Bearwood Corporate Services, controlled by Lord Ashcroft,
were legal. The party would have faced having to pay the money back had the electoral watchdog reached the opposite
conclusion.
However, the commission added its regret that the Tories refused to agree to interviews and that Lord Ashcroft had
destroyed documents relating to the ownership of the company.","UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05767969 Date: 08/31/2015

The Conservatives are becoming exasperated by the rumors that appear in the press and elsewhere that they are

An FT interview with Hillary Clinton
By Daniel Dombey
FT
June 11 2010 22:21
This is what it is like to be Hillary Clinton. The motorcade, twisting and skidding through rain-splashed
streets for more than an hour; the public meetings and camera lights at journey's end; the spotlight that
has not let up for two decades. It is almost as if the 2008 US presidential election - hailed as the most
exciting for a generation - had never ended.
But this is a campaign without a vote. Today, Clinton's convoy is snaking through Sao Paulo, Brazil, not
South Hampton, New Hampshire. She herself is no longer an aspirant for the White House, despite what
the overnight flights, town hall meetings and strategy sessions that make up her gruelling schedule might
suggest. Instead, she is in Latin America to shore up relations with the region and promote a new idea of
US leadership, one very much built around herself.
She's had bigger and more ecstatic audiences than the 700-odd students and staff crammed into the hall
tonight at Zumbi dos Pradares, an Afro-Brazilian university, but she's still greeted by a wave of raised
arms as the audience snaps away at her with their mobile phones.
In the convoy moments before, she was wrapped in a shawl, suffering from a cold and angry at the delays
that pushed us into the side streets speckled with box-like bars, warehouses and love hotels while
Brazilian motorists sought to cut into our path. There is no sign of that now. With the metabolism of a
born politician, she feeds off the energy of her audience and takes questions from students, teachers and
local celebrities for an hour. Hillary Clinton never looks happier than when she is centre stage.
Most US secretaries of state wouldn't bother with this sort of event, much less initiate it and arrange for it
to be screened on the biggest local channel. Yet this is what Clinton does on almost every foreign trip -
and she seems to spend half her life on her official 727, crammed with long-time aides and armed
bodyguards. The schedule is backbreaking and constantly shifting. She has notched up more than a
quarter of a million miles since taking office.
On this Latin America trip, thrown into confusion by an earthquake in Chile, we have already visited four
countries in 24 hours. We go to tiny Uruguay, where our stay is so brief we check into a hotel just for a
shower; Argentina, where we spend almost all our time at the presidential palace; Chile itself, where we
don't leave the airport; and Brazil, where we spend almost a full day.
So what exactly is Clinton trying to do on this never-ending world tour? Travelling with her for a week,
talking to people inside and outside the administration, I tried to find out.
""We now have a case to make and it is not just a case that is made to the president or the prime minister
or the foreign minister or an ambassador,"" she tells me a few weeks later, as she perches on a sofa in her
expansive office, with its view of the Lincoln Memorial. ""People now have a voice and an opinion and a
vote in many instances on the direction that their own societies take ... I want to model a different kind of
leadership that is open and willing to listen but [also] to stand our ground if necessary.""
She argues that these trips of hers help to restore the US's image in the wake of the Bush administration
- by making contact with public opinion abroad, and so boosting American power. Her aides say that, as a
battle-hardened politician who also happens to be one of the most famous women in the world, she is
ideally placed to carry out the task. But the deeper question is whether she is merely implementing the
foreign policy crafted by Barack Obama, her boss and former rival, or whether her role - and ambitions -
go beyond that.
Is she a kind of saleswoman-in-chief for the US, I ask? ""Well, I think that is part of the job,"" she replies,
toying with the napkin underneath her glass of water. ""If you are making a case for American values and
for American leadership, you have to make it where people now get information ... Given the bridges we
had to build and some of the repair work we had to do, we had to travel.""
As in S'ao Paulo, her system is under strain - ""I've been fighting this all day,"" she says as she masks a
cough set off by her allergies (Washington's cherry blossom trees are shedding their flowers). Life is still
hectic - the volcanic ash cloud has just all but paralysed Europe and televisions throughout the State
Department are showing the first British election debate. But Clinton remains enthusiastic, affable and
unhurried, her speech peppered with exclamations such as ""oh my gosh"", even as she discusses issues of
state. She politely asks if I have any updates for her about Europe's airspace shutdown and tells me she's
been talking to Norway's foreign minister about it.
""He said that this dust gets into engines of any size, even Air Force One - it's chunky! I don't know how
else to describe it,"" she says, an odd note of hilarity entering her voice as she pronounces the word
""chunky"".
Clinton often speaks in this eager, unvarnished way - a world away from the clipped, on-message manner
of her immediate predecessor in the post, Condoleezza Rice. If anything, she is an undiplomat - known
less for calibrated circumlocutions than for her plain speaking and sometimes her gaffes, a woman who
retains both a formidable political constituency and a laugh she once admitted can send cats scurrying
from a room.
Her staff point out she is only the third elected politician in 60 years to have served as secretary of state,
and the first to come from outside the foreign policy establishment since James Baker, George H.W.
Bush's right-hand man and perhaps her most illustrious recent predecessor. She may be the most
substantive politician in the office since William Jennings Bryan, the three-time presidential candidate who
served as secretary almost a century ago. ""Her stature on the world stage, her almost presidential
stature, has set her apart,"" Bill Burns, the top career diplomat at the State Department, tells me. ""Leaders
want to meet her. And the town hall meetings do make a difference with public opinion.""
State visitor Hillary Clinton is greeted by Air Force Base Commander Colonel Celso de Araujo at S'ao Paulo
airport in March
Back in Sao Paulo, the meeting at the university ranges far from the confines and dramatis personae of
traditional diplomacy. Annie, a young woman with red and blue dreadlocked hair, tells Clinton about her
dance and percussion classes and asks how to study in the US without paying college fees. A nervous
young man confesses himself lost halfway through an abstruse question about tariff policy; Clinton,
smiling and nodding in that vaguely automatic way of hers, bears with him all the same. Another female
student asks for an autograph. When answering, Clinton sometimes opens her eyes wide as she
emphasises a phrase; at other moments, seemingly at random, she pulls her hands apart as if
demonstrating the size of a fish.
Then a law student called Marina asks about abortion - which is illegal in Brazil - and Clinton moves into
treacherous terrain. She speaks of the Brazilian hospital she visited in the 1990s that treated not just
expectant mothers but women suffering from the consequences of backstreet abortions. ""Wealthy women
have rights in every country,"" she says. ""And poor women don't."" Her strength of feeling can't be hidden
as she denounces ""the great toll that illegal abortions take and the denial of women being able to exercise
such a fundamental personal right"".
Tom Shannon, the US ambassador to Brazil, tells me later: ""I understand the possible concern that we
might have come close to domestic issues. But she wasn't laying out a prescription for Brazil. She was
sharing her experience as a woman in American politics and as secretary of state."" It's true: Clinton
doesn't quite cross the line. Onstage, she is controlled without seeming artificial, convivial without
appearing over-effusive, what a previous age would call a real trouper. At the podium she looks straight
ahead, her lips carefully expressionless. Still, the old competitive instincts haven't left her. Perhaps it is
the lecterns at press conferences, reminiscent of the Democratic presidential debates, but on exiting the
podium at a joint appearance with Argentina's president Cristina Fernandez, Clinton makes clear her
satisfaction at having had the last word. The expert debater who usually bested Obama has not left the
stage.
Yet that competitive urge coexists with what one insider describes as her ""almost inhuman loyalty""
towards Obama. Her mastery of the facts - an ""information carnivore"" one of her officials calls her -
comes despite the consensus in much of Washington that her role consists largely of implementing the
foreign policy Obama and his inner circle have framed, rather than helping frame it herself.
In Sao Paulo, she shows her loyalty in striking fashion when she is asked repeatedly about positive
discrimination - another sensitive topic in Brazil - not least because, Clinton herself observes, Afro-
Brazilians account for more than half the country's population but only 2 per cent of university students.
""That suggests to me that some special steps need to be taken [in] recruiting and admitting students so
that they can have a chance to succeed,"" she tells the hall, again inching towards domestic politics, before
speaking of her pride in the progress the US civil rights movement has made in the past half-century. She
says: ""The election of Barack Obama, many believe, was the greatest accomplishment of all because it
demonstrated that an African-American could be elected president of the United States.""
Among the crowd, I catch my breath and scribble down her words. It's hard to think of a more fulsome
statement from the woman who fought so hard against Obama - and who squandered a huge poll lead
and millions of dollars in the struggle against him.
The great collaborator Clinton has established strong working relationships within the Obama
administration
When I ask Clinton later about how she managed to move from the antagonism of the primary race to the
obedience of office, she dismisses my question with an anodyne ""that's politics"". She adds: ""We're
working really hard and well together ... It just never comes up any more, it seems like ancient history to
me."" Not so ancient, I think, that she is willing to admit the failings of her campaign. ""I always run
inclusive and successful organisations,"" she retorts when I ask her whether she'd applied any lessons from
that searing experience to her new post.
She admits she didn't want the job at State - she says she was exhausted by the election and missed the
Senate -. ""but at the end of the day, I'm pretty old-fashioned and if the president asks you to do
something, you'd better have a really good reason why you can't."" Also, she adds: ""Suppose I had won
and I were asking him to be in my cabinet ... I would have wanted him to say yes.""
Others say the relationship is more complex, that by dint of her loyalty and unflagging hard work, Clinton
has moved closer to the charmed circle and made herself an even more formidable political force than
before. ""Quite simply, she gives good advice and the president over a year and a half has recognised
that,"" says Anne-Marie Slaughter, head of the State Department policy planning unit. ""The relationship is
based on her performance in the job.""
By all accounts, it's a collaborative partnership, though not perhaps a warm one. Clinton boasts a good
working relationship with the main players of the administration - and has formed something of an
alliance with defence secretary Robert Gates, although on life-and-death issues such as Afghanistan, it is
Gates, not her, who has taken the lead. As one official told me, secretaries of state have often either been
popular with their own department - Colin Powell comes to mind - or with the rest of the administration -
as was Condoleezza Rice - but Clinton has managed to be both.
In truth, Clinton's language remains harder-edged than Obama's - she recently claimed that Iran's
Revolutionary Guard had staged a slow-motion coup - and she has sometimes been more willing than he
is to hint at using the military. ""She seems to step up with a bit of spine just at the right time,"" says Kurt
Volker, a US ambassador to Nato under George W. Bush.
She has also assumed an ever more prominent role in talking to leaders such as Benjamin Netanyahu of
Israel and Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan - apparently because she is trusted both by them and Obama.
Meanwhile, she has been careful to keep her husband, the former US president, in the background. Aides
say they have barely seen him in the building - though Clinton herself says that behind the scenes Bill
Clinton gives her strategic advice. ""One of his favourite sayings, that I remind myself of all the time, is a
kind of baseball saying,"" she says: ""Don't major in the minors; keep your eye on not just the headlines
but the trend lines.""
It is her co-operative stance rather than any notable effort to set out a grand vision of her own that is the
chief theme of her time so far at State. When I ask Clinton to name her proudest achievement in office,
she replies ""the effective and collaborative approach that this administration has taken towards identifying
and solving problems."" A more process-oriented, less provocative answer would be hard to imagine.
But maybe, I think, the US has less scope for grand strategy than it did in the past couple of decades,
when the country seemed to bestride the world colossus-style. Clinton herself suggests that so formidable
are the tasks confronting the US that the administration has little scope to enter into internecine fights but
needs instead to focus on the challenges to hand. Whatever the reason for her stance, it seems to be a
smart decision - by all accounts she's overcome many of the suspicions the White House retinue had
towards her.
""It's fair to say that she was not born into the administration's inner circle but slowly but surely, for the
most consequential decisions, she now has a prime seat at the table,"" says one official. Praising what he
calls her ""Terminator-quality durability and determination,"" he adds: ""She's done an amazing amount of
work, judging that the way to build a strategic vision is bottom up, by mastering the details.""
Indeed, Clinton's ability to master the most arcane foreign policy briefs is the marvel of her building. She
has dropped into obscure working groups and shown an unnerving knowledge of their details. At her
confirmation hearings last year she exchanged facts about the arctic with an Alaskan senator; at the
meeting in So Paulo she becomes enthused about freight transport policy both in Brazil and the US. She
herself acknowledges that finding her feet on foreign policy was something of a struggle, despite her
campaign claims of expertise in the field. ""It was so intellectually challenging, just to get our arms around
all of these issues,"" she says. During her first year, she was criticised for apparent gaffes - including the
way she called for Israel to halt all building of settlements on occupied territory only to hail a partial freeze
a few months later as unprecedented. On an election campaign, she says, ""you may be in a different city
four times a day but you have a message you're trying to deliver that is repetitive and aimed at your
audience. But here you might deal with 10 different countries' problems, six different regional or global
challenges in the course of a day.""
As the Latin America tour shows, she is now trying to do both - travel incessantly and solve an array of
international issues. She is at the forefront of the US's efforts to consolidate relations with a number of
important countries - predominantly Russia and China, but also rising powers such as Brazil, Turkey,
Indonesia and South Africa - and to cool down anti-American feeling in hotspots, notably Pakistan. She
says the push is working, hailing a ""change in public opinion in places that were pretty negative about the
US"" - a reference to Russia and Pakistan. But it is far from smooth sailing. Differences about Iran and
over Israel's raid on aid-bearing ships off Gaza have stoked tensions with Turkey and Brazil recently, amid
questioning of the effectiveness of the Obama administration's policies.
During my time with her on the road, the stop in Brazil is the focal point - not surprising given the
country's increased profile as Latin America leader. Clinton is now heading the administration's push to
secure sanctions on Iran, and in Brasilia she tries and fails to win President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva to her
cause. She employs an almost combative tone at a press conference with Celso Amorim, Brazil's foreign
minister. At moments she appears to barely contain her irritation, as she denounces ""an Iran that runs to
Brazil"" as well as other countries such as Turkey and China ""telling different things to different people to
avoid international sanctions"". Amorim is spiky in his own way - drawing parallels to the 1990s sanctions
on Iraq and the claims about weapons of mass destruction before the 2003 war. ""Of course, I don't agree
with everything the Secretary said,"" he says.
It is not a happy experience - indeed this past week both Brazil and Turkey voted against sanctions at the
United Nations - yet Hillary Clinton is nowhere near giving up. Years ago, one of Bill Clinton's biographers
described his approach to government as a ""permanent campaign"", and it appears to be his wife's
preferred form of existence as well. If there is one constant in Clinton's life, it is that she never throws in
her cards, whether what motivates her is power or public service.
""Never, never!"" she exclaims, when I ask whether she ever thought of walking off into the wings after the
frustrations and indignities of her time at the White House. ""I have a very realistic sense of what high-
stakes politics requires and it took me a while to get there because it's shocking when you are in the
arena ... but once you figure it out, you can take it seriously for purposes of analysis and understanding,
but you can't take it personally."" Such treatment seems to rankle all the same. She's been listening to
coverage ahead of the British debate and is plainly irritated by the coverage of the leaders' wives.
""Whether a woman's running for office or she's supporting her husband who's running for office and she
gets criticised for wearing open-toed shoes or for the colour of her coat, there's just a lot of history that
you bear if you are a woman who puts herself out in the political arena,"" she says.
Another country Clinton boards her official 727 to fly from Sao Paulo to Costa Rica
Injustice towards women appears to be the issue that most enthuses Clinton in this job - as in her many
other incarnations in American public life, whether as First Lady or before. ""I feel passionately it is in not
just the American national security interests but the world's, that women be given the opportunities and
the tools to make the most out of their own lives,"" she says.
In the 1990s she steered clear of reading the newspapers because of the way she was treated. Today, she
says, ""I certainly don't read coverage of me, I read what else is going on that I need to know about to do
my job."" ""It's all baloney,"" says Philippe Reines, her press adviser, who set up the meeting with her and is
sitting to one side in her office.
""Yeah, yeah, right, that's what he tells me,"" Clinton responds.
I wonder. She may not read the stories about her, but she has boosted her domestic profile still further by
talking to American magazines such as Esquire, Vogue and Parade. To what end? Clinton has said she will
only serve one four-year term as secretary of state - understandable, given the grind of the job. When I
ask whether she expects a woman president in the next decade or so, she responds: ""I'd love that,
obviously I would love that. I want to be front and centre when it happens.""
""Any chance it would be you?"" I ask.
""No, no, I don't think that's in the cards,"" Clinton says. She's given more categoric denials in the past. ""I
think that there's a whole generation of young women and not so young, but mature, seasoned women
who are earning their stripes and recognising how tough it is out there. It is not for the faint of heart to
run for president, and I believe it is harder for women, it just is, and that's just a fact."" But, says one US
official, ""all the profiles and all this media treatment undercut the argument that she is finished with
electoral politics. Why do all this stuff? She's already Hillary Clinton. You have to ask: 'What's the idea
behind raising her domestic profile still further?""
Indeed she is now, by some counts, the most popular politician in America and some in Washington say
she could be a good fit for the vice-presidential slot in the 2012 elections.
Back in Sao Paulo, once the town hall meeting is over, Clinton faces a seven-hour flight to Costa Rica. The
journey goes on and on, and as saleswoman-in-chief for the US in an unruly world, she faces a long, hard
road. Today the US sometimes struggles to assert itself on the world stage. But the obstacles are rather
fewer if the product she is pitching is herself. A secretary of state like none before her, Hillary Clinton,
long one of the most formidable figures in US politics, is looking stronger than ever.
Daniel Dombey is the FT's US diplomatic correspondent
David Miliband: ""Hillary is a rock star ... she has a great sense of fun, and a great sense of humour""
It's too early to start chalking up a scorecard because Hillary Clinton, and the Obama administration, is
laying the foundations for long-term change in America's foreign policy. The challenges are immense -
probably more difficult than the inheritance of any previous administration. But American leadership is
essential and a commitment to multilateralism - in fact multi, multilateralism using different and
overlapping forums - is real and right.
You also have to remember that Hillary is a rock star. When I arrived at the Nato Foreign Ministers
meeting in March 2009, it was a nice surprise that all the staff, never mind the press, seemed to have
turned out in droves for my arrival. Then I realised that Hillary was 10 minutes behind me.
That said, the thing that most surprised me about working with Clinton was not her intelligence or her
hard work, all of which are well known, but that behind the serious exterior is someone who has a great
sense of fun, and a great sense of humour. She has seen politics from all sides, and can laugh at herself
as well as at others.
She's a remarkably good listener, always synthesising ideas and opinions to develop her own. She thinks
strategically as well as tactically. She's also very, very unpompous. Hillary is a very political person but in
a particular way, she honours politics and public service and believes that democratic politics is not a
necessary evil, but a calling of value and vocation. She knows you win some and you lose some, but it's
essential to take part.
There's one other thing. Hillary is a people person in that she thinks deeply about the psychology of the
people she's dealing with. Their motivation, their loyalties, their culture. It's real emotional intelligence in
trying to understand why people disagree and how you can get them to agree. I think that must be why
so many other members of the administration say she is a very good colleague.
David Miliband is shadow foreign secretary
Gideon Rachman: ""Relations between the White House and the State Department are not particularly
close""
A school teacher asked to write a report on Hillary Clinton's stint as secretary of state would have to give
her 10/10 for effort but a rather more modest mark for actual achievements - maybe a six or a seven.
Secretaries of state are generally judged on two criteria. First, how have they done in the endless
bureaucratic turf wars that characterise Washington politics? Second, how effective have they been in
promoting US foreign policy in the wider world? Success in one area usually helps in the other. Henry
Kissinger was a superb Washington infighter - and his close relationship with President Nixon made him
all the more effective overseas. Colin Powell, George W. Bush's first secretary of state, was widely
admired outside the US - but came out on the wrong side of many of the Washington battles, which
limited his ability to get things done in the wider world.
Hillary Clinton has skilfully avoided being sucked into the debilitating Washington struggles that so
damaged Powell. Despite the often poisonous rivalry between the Obama and Clinton camps during the
campaign, Clinton has a good working relationship with the president. But while relations between the
White House and the State Department are cordial, they do not seem to be particularly close. Clinton
appointed many loyalists from her own campaign to the State Department, with the result that State is
rather detached from Obama's inner circle. Obama's penchant for making high-profile speeches in foreign
capitals such as Cairo, Prague, Tokyo and Istanbul means that the president himself has done more than
anyone else to define his administration's approach to the world.
That still leaves a role for Clinton to fill in the crucial details of policy. But special representatives have
been appointed to deal with Afghanistan and the Middle East - and the Treasury is critical to China policy.
Asked about Clinton's impact as secretary of state, one senior European policymaker purses his lips and
says: ""She's done some great trips, and she's highly professional. But it's hard to see any particular area
where she has really driven policy.""
Gideon Rachman is the FT's chief foreign affairs columnist
David Rothkopf: ""When she has been asked to deliver tough messages, she has done so unflinchingly""
Hillary Clinton has been a cautious secretary of state: she has protected the president well and pursued
his agenda without upstaging him - an early concern, given her stature. She has worked very well with
other members of the cabinet, and is reconsidering the role and structure of the State Department.
That includes a review of the role of diplomacy going forward. Clinton has not only acknowledged the rise
of new powers and a changing global power structure but has taken steps to reshape US foreign policy
structure accordingly. An important part of that has been recognising the importance of co-operating with
private and non-state actors such as NG0s, as well as dealing with non-state threats.
When the administration has called upon her to deliver tough messages, she has done so unflinchingly.
This has allowed the president to articulate a strategic vision which Clinton then goes about implementing.
Still, neither the secretary of state nor the president determines the global situation. The US may be the
most powerful country in the world but it is one among many powerful countries, and many aspects of the
situation we face today are beyond our control. The Obama administration has been dealt an extremely
difficult hand: not only Iraq and Afghanistan, but Iran and North Korea's nuclear programmes, the rise of
emerging powers and a complex and still unfolding series of financial crises.
We have gone from a world in which the US thought it had limitless resources and unbounded options to
one where the limits are clear; from a world in which you could work in the GB to one where you have to
work in the context of the G20; a world where new technologies and new powers play a bigger role. All of
those things would dictate a change in foreign policy regardless of who is in office.
Hillary Clinton has established a very solid foundation. The next step is to identify a couple of signature
issues - and have a couple of signature successes. That will take her to the next level.

As in S'ao Paulo, her system is under strain - ""I've been fighting this all day,"" she says as she masks a
cough set off by her allergies (Washington's cherry blossom trees are shedding their flowers). Life is still
hectic - the volcanic ash cloud has just all but paralysed Europe and televisions throughout the State
Department are showing the first British election debate. But Clinton remains enthusiastic, affable and
unhurried, her speech peppered with exclamations such as ""oh my gosh"", even as she discusses issues of
state. She politely asks if I have any updates for her about Europe's airspace shutdown and tells me she's
been talking to Norway's foreign minister about it.
""He said that this dust gets into engines of any size, even Air Force One - it's chunky! I don't know how
else to describe it,"" she says, an odd note of hilarity entering her voice as she pronounces the word
""chunky"".
Clinton often speaks in this eager, unvarnished way - a world away from the clipped, on-message manner
of her immediate predecessor in the post, Condoleezza Rice. If anything, she is an undiplomat - known
less for calibrated circumlocutions than for her plain speaking and sometimes her gaffes, a woman who
retains both a formidable political constituency and a laugh she once admitted can send cats scurrying
from a room.
Her staff point out she is only the third elected politician in 60 years to have served as secretary of state,
and the first to come from outside the foreign policy establishment since James Baker, George H.W.
Bush's right-hand man and perhaps her most illustrious recent predecessor. She may be the most
substantive politician in the office since William Jennings Bryan, the three-time presidential candidate who
served as secretary almost a century ago. ""Her stature on the world stage, her almost presidential
stature, has set her apart,"" Bill Burns, the top career diplomat at the State Department, tells me. ""Leaders
want to meet her. And the town hall meetings do make a difference with public opinion.""
State visitor Hillary Clinton is greeted by Air Force Base Commander Colonel Celso de Araujo at S'ao Paulo
airport in March
Back in Sao Paulo, the meeting at the university ranges far from the confines and dramatis personae of
traditional diplomacy. Annie, a young woman with red and blue dreadlocked hair, tells Clinton about her
dance and percussion classes and asks how to study in the US without paying college fees. A nervous
young man confesses himself lost halfway through an abstruse question about tariff policy; Clinton,
smiling and nodding in that vaguely automatic way of hers, bears with him all the same. Another female
student asks for an autograph. When answering, Clinton sometimes opens her eyes wide as she
emphasises a phrase; at other moments, seemingly at random, she pulls her hands apart as if
demonstrating the size of a fish.
Then a law student called Marina asks about abortion - which is illegal in Brazil - and Clinton moves into
treacherous terrain. She speaks of the Brazilian hospital she visited in the 1990s that treated not just

expectant mothers but women suffering from the consequences of backstreet abortions. ""Wealthy women
have rights in every country,"" she says. ""And poor women don't."" Her strength of feeling can't be hidden
as she denounces ""the great toll that illegal abortions take and the denial of women being able to exercise
such a fundamental personal right"".
Tom Shannon, the US ambassador to Brazil, tells me later: ""I understand the possible concern that we
might have come close to domestic issues. But she wasn't laying out a prescription for Brazil. She was
sharing her experience as a woman in American politics and as secretary of state."" It's true: Clinton
doesn't quite cross the line. Onstage, she is controlled without seeming artificial, convivial without
appearing over-effusive, what a previous age would call a real trouper. At the podium she looks straight
ahead, her lips carefully expressionless. Still, the old competitive instincts haven't left her. Perhaps it is
the lecterns at press conferences, reminiscent of the Democratic presidential debates, but on exiting the
podium at a joint appearance with Argentina's president Cristina Fernandez, Clinton makes clear her
satisfaction at having had the last word. The expert debater who usually bested Obama has not left the
stage.
Yet that competitive urge coexists with what one insider describes as her ""almost inhuman loyalty""
towards Obama. Her mastery of the facts - an ""information carnivore"" one of her officials calls her -
comes despite the consensus in much of Washington that her role consists largely of implementing the
foreign policy Obama and his inner circle have framed, rather than helping frame it herself.
In Sao Paulo, she shows her loyalty in striking fashion when she is asked repeatedly about positive
discrimination - another sensitive topic in Brazil - not least because, Clinton herself observes, Afro-
Brazilians account for more than half the country's population but only 2 per cent of university students.
""That suggests to me that some special steps need to be taken [in] recruiting and admitting students so
that they can have a chance to succeed,"" she tells the hall, again inching towards domestic politics, before
speaking of her pride in the progress the US civil rights movement has made in the past half-century. She
says: ""The election of Barack Obama, many believe, was the greatest accomplishment of all because it
demonstrated that an African-American could be elected president of the United States.""
Among the crowd, I catch my breath and scribble down her words. It's hard to think of a more fulsome
statement from the woman who fought so hard against Obama - and who squandered a huge poll lead
and millions of dollars in the struggle against him.
The great collaborator Clinton has established strong working relationships within the Obama
administration
When I ask Clinton later about how she managed to move from the antagonism of the primary race to the
obedience of office, she dismisses my question with an anodyne ""that's politics"". She adds: ""We're
working really hard and well together ... It just never comes up any more, it seems like ancient history to
me."" Not so ancient, I think, that she is willing to admit the failings of her campaign. ""I always run
inclusive and successful organisations,"" she retorts when I ask her whether she'd applied any lessons from
that searing experience to her new post.
She admits she didn't want the job at State - she says she was exhausted by the election and missed the
Senate -. ""but at the end of the day, I'm pretty old-fashioned and if the president asks you to do
something, you'd better have a really good reason why you can't."" Also, she adds: ""Suppose I had won
and I were asking him to be in my cabinet ... I would have wanted him to say yes.""
Others say the relationship is more complex, that by dint of her loyalty and unflagging hard work, Clinton
has moved closer to the charmed circle and made herself an even more formidable political force than
before. ""Quite simply, she gives good advice and the president over a year and a half has recognised
that,"" says Anne-Marie Slaughter, head of the State Department policy planning unit. ""The relationship is
based on her performance in the job.""
By all accounts, it's a collaborative partnership, though not perhaps a warm one. Clinton boasts a good
working relationship with the main players of the administration - and has formed something of an
alliance with defence secretary Robert Gates, although on life-and-death issues such as Afghanistan, it is
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05769875 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05769875 Date: 08/31/2015
Gates, not her, who has taken the lead. As one official told me, secretaries of state have often either been
popular with their own department - Colin Powell comes to mind - or with the rest of the administration -
as was Condoleezza Rice - but Clinton has managed to be both.
In truth, Clinton's language remains harder-edged than Obama's - she recently claimed that Iran's
Revolutionary Guard had staged a slow-motion coup - and she has sometimes been more willing than he
is to hint at using the military. ""She seems to step up with a bit of spine just at the right time,"" says Kurt
Volker, a US ambassador to Nato under George W. Bush.
She has also assumed an ever more prominent role in talking to leaders such as Benjamin Netanyahu of
Israel and Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan - apparently because she is trusted both by them and Obama.
Meanwhile, she has been careful to keep her husband, the former US president, in the background. Aides
say they have barely seen him in the building - though Clinton herself says that behind the scenes Bill
Clinton gives her strategic advice. ""One of his favourite sayings, that I remind myself of all the time, is a
kind of baseball saying,"" she says: ""Don't major in the minors; keep your eye on not just the headlines
but the trend lines.""
It is her co-operative stance rather than any notable effort to set out a grand vision of her own that is the
chief theme of her time so far at State. When I ask Clinton to name her proudest achievement in office,
she replies ""the effective and collaborative approach that this administration has taken towards identifying
and solving problems."" A more process-oriented, less provocative answer would be hard to imagine.
But maybe, I think, the US has less scope for grand strategy than it did in the past couple of decades,
when the country seemed to bestride the world colossus-style. Clinton herself suggests that so formidable
are the tasks confronting the US that the administration has little scope to enter into internecine fights but
needs instead to focus on the challenges to hand. Whatever the reason for her stance, it seems to be a
smart decision - by all accounts she's overcome many of the suspicions the White House retinue had
towards her.
""It's fair to say that she was not born into the administration's inner circle but slowly but surely, for the
most consequential decisions, she now has a prime seat at the table,"" says one official. Praising what he
calls her ""Terminator-quality durability and determination,"" he adds: ""She's done an amazing amount of
work, judging that the way to build a strategic vision is bottom up, by mastering the details.""
Indeed, Clinton's ability to master the most arcane foreign policy briefs is the marvel of her building. She
has dropped into obscure working groups and shown an unnerving knowledge of their details. At her
confirmation hearings last year she exchanged facts about the arctic with an Alaskan senator; at the
meeting in So Paulo she becomes enthused about freight transport policy both in Brazil and the US. She
herself acknowledges that finding her feet on foreign policy was something of a struggle, despite her
campaign claims of expertise in the field. ""It was so intellectually challenging, just to get our arms around
all of these issues,"" she says. During her first year, she was criticised for apparent gaffes - including the
way she called for Israel to halt all building of settlements on occupied territory only to hail a partial freeze
a few months later as unprecedented. On an election campaign, she says, ""you may be in a different city
four times a day but you have a message you're trying to deliver that is repetitive and aimed at your
audience. But here you might deal with 10 different countries' problems, six different regional or global
challenges in the course of a day.""
As the Latin America tour shows, she is now trying to do both - travel incessantly and solve an array of
international issues. She is at the forefront of the US's efforts to consolidate relations with a number of
important countries - predominantly Russia and China, but also rising powers such as Brazil, Turkey,
Indonesia and South Africa - and to cool down anti-American feeling in hotspots, notably Pakistan. She
says the push is working, hailing a ""change in public opinion in places that were pretty negative about the
US"" - a reference to Russia and Pakistan. But it is far from smooth sailing. Differences about Iran and
over Israel's raid on aid-bearing ships off Gaza have stoked tensions with Turkey and Brazil recently, amid
questioning of the effectiveness of the Obama administration's policies.
During my time with her on the road, the stop in Brazil is the focal point - not surprising given the
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05769875 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05769875 Date: 08/31/2015
country's increased profile as Latin America leader. Clinton is now heading the administration's push to
secure sanctions on Iran, and in Brasilia she tries and fails to win President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva to her
cause. She employs an almost combative tone at a press conference with Celso Amorim, Brazil's foreign
minister. At moments she appears to barely contain her irritation, as she denounces ""an Iran that runs to
Brazil"" as well as other countries such as Turkey and China ""telling different things to different people to
avoid international sanctions"". Amorim is spiky in his own way - drawing parallels to the 1990s sanctions
on Iraq and the claims about weapons of mass destruction before the 2003 war. ""Of course, I don't agree
with everything the Secretary said,"" he says.
It is not a happy experience - indeed this past week both Brazil and Turkey voted against sanctions at the
United Nations - yet Hillary Clinton is nowhere near giving up. Years ago, one of Bill Clinton's biographers
described his approach to government as a ""permanent campaign"", and it appears to be his wife's
preferred form of existence as well. If there is one constant in Clinton's life, it is that she never throws in
her cards, whether what motivates her is power or public service.
""Never, never!"" she exclaims, when I ask whether she ever thought of walking off into the wings after the
frustrations and indignities of her time at the White House. ""I have a very realistic sense of what high-
stakes politics requires and it took me a while to get there because it's shocking when you are in the
arena ... but once you figure it out, you can take it seriously for purposes of analysis and understanding,
but you can't take it personally."" Such treatment seems to rankle all the same. She's been listening to
coverage ahead of the British debate and is plainly irritated by the coverage of the leaders' wives.
""Whether a woman's running for office or she's supporting her husband who's running for office and she
gets criticised for wearing open-toed shoes or for the colour of her coat, there's just a lot of history that
you bear if you are a woman who puts herself out in the political arena,"" she says.
Another country Clinton boards her official 727 to fly from Sao Paulo to Costa Rica
Injustice towards women appears to be the issue that most enthuses Clinton in this job - as in her many
other incarnations in American public life, whether as First Lady or before. ""I feel passionately it is in not
just the American national security interests but the world's, that women be given the opportunities and
the tools to make the most out of their own lives,"" she says.
In the 1990s she steered clear of reading the newspapers because of the way she was treated. Today, she
says, ""I certainly don't read coverage of me, I read what else is going on that I need to know about to do
my job."" ""It's all baloney,"" says Philippe Reines, her press adviser, who set up the meeting with her and is
sitting to one side in her office.
""Yeah, yeah, right, that's what he tells me,"" Clinton responds.
I wonder. She may not read the stories about her, but she has boosted her domestic profile still further by
talking to American magazines such as Esquire, Vogue and Parade. To what end? Clinton has said she will
only serve one four-year term as secretary of state - understandable, given the grind of the job. When I
ask whether she expects a woman president in the next decade or so, she responds: ""I'd love that,
obviously I would love that. I want to be front and centre when it happens.""
""Any chance it would be you?"" I ask.
""No, no, I don't think that's in the cards,"" Clinton says. She's given more categoric denials in the past. ""I
think that there's a whole generation of young women and not so young, but mature, seasoned women
who are earning their stripes and recognising how tough it is out there. It is not for the faint of heart to
run for president, and I believe it is harder for women, it just is, and that's just a fact."" But, says one US
official, ""all the profiles and all this media treatment undercut the argument that she is finished with
electoral politics. Why do all this stuff? She's already Hillary Clinton. You have to ask: 'What's the idea
behind raising her domestic profile still further?""
Indeed she is now, by some counts, the most popular politician in America and some in Washington say
she could be a good fit for the vice-presidential slot in the 2012 elections.

Back in Sao Paulo, once the town hall meeting is over, Clinton faces a seven-hour flight to Costa Rica. The
journey goes on and on, and as saleswoman-in-chief for the US in an unruly world, she faces a long, hard
road. Today the US sometimes struggles to assert itself on the world stage. But the obstacles are rather
fewer if the product she is pitching is herself. A secretary of state like none before her, Hillary Clinton,
long one of the most formidable figures in US politics, is looking stronger than ever.
Daniel Dombey is the FT's US diplomatic correspondent
David Miliband: ""Hillary is a rock star ... she has a great sense of fun, and a great sense of humour""
It's too early to start chalking up a scorecard because Hillary Clinton, and the Obama administration, is
laying the foundations for long-term change in America's foreign policy. The challenges are immense -
probably more difficult than the inheritance of any previous administration. But American leadership is
essential and a commitment to multilateralism - in fact multi, multilateralism using different and
overlapping forums - is real and right.
You also have to remember that Hillary is a rock star. When I arrived at the Nato Foreign Ministers
meeting in March 2009, it was a nice surprise that all the staff, never mind the press, seemed to have
turned out in droves for my arrival. Then I realised that Hillary was 10 minutes behind me.
That said, the thing that most surprised me about working with Clinton was not her intelligence or her
hard work, all of which are well known, but that behind the serious exterior is someone who has a great
sense of fun, and a great sense of humour. She has seen politics from all sides, and can laugh at herself
as well as at others.
She's a remarkably good listener, always synthesising ideas and opinions to develop her own. She thinks
strategically as well as tactically. She's also very, very unpompous. Hillary is a very political person but in
a particular way, she honours politics and public service and believes that democratic politics is not a
necessary evil, but a calling of value and vocation. She knows you win some and you lose some, but it's
essential to take part.
There's one other thing. Hillary is a people person in that she thinks deeply about the psychology of the
people she's dealing with. Their motivation, their loyalties, their culture. It's real emotional intelligence in
trying to understand why people disagree and how you can get them to agree. I think that must be why
so many other members of the administration say she is a very good colleague.

Gideon Rachman: ""Relations between the White House and the State Department are not particularly
close""
A school teacher asked to write a report on Hillary Clinton's stint as secretary of state would have to give
her 10/10 for effort but a rather more modest mark for actual achievements - maybe a six or a seven.
Secretaries of state are generally judged on two criteria. First, how have they done in the endless
bureaucratic turf wars that characterise Washington politics? Second, how effective have they been in
promoting US foreign policy in the wider world? Success in one area usually helps in the other. Henry
Kissinger was a superb Washington infighter - and his close relationship with President Nixon made him
all the more effective overseas. Colin Powell, George W. Bush's first secretary of state, was widely
admired outside the US - but came out on the wrong side of many of the Washington battles, which
limited his ability to get things done in the wider world.
Hillary Clinton has skilfully avoided being sucked into the debilitating Washington struggles that so
damaged Powell. Despite the often poisonous rivalry between the Obama and Clinton camps during the
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05769875 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05769875 Date: 08/31/2015
campaign, Clinton has a good working relationship with the president. But while relations between the
White House and the State Department are cordial, they do not seem to be particularly close. Clinton
appointed many loyalists from her own campaign to the State Department, with the result that State is
rather detached from Obama's inner circle. Obama's penchant for making high-profile speeches in foreign
capitals such as Cairo, Prague, Tokyo and Istanbul means that the president himself has done more than
anyone else to define his administration's approach to the world.
That still leaves a role for Clinton to fill in the crucial details of policy. But special representatives have
been appointed to deal with Afghanistan and the Middle East - and the Treasury is critical to China policy.
Asked about Clinton's impact as secretary of state, one senior European policymaker purses his lips and
says: ""She's done some great trips, and she's highly professional. But it's hard to see any particular area
where she has really driven policy.""
Gideon Rachman is the FT's chief foreign affairs columnist
David Rothkopf: ""When she has been asked to deliver tough messages, she has done so unflinchingly""
Hillary Clinton has been a cautious secretary of state: she has protected the president well and pursued
his agenda without upstaging him - an early concern, given her stature. She has worked very well with
other members of the cabinet, and is reconsidering the role and structure of the State Department.
That includes a review of the role of diplomacy going forward. Clinton has not only acknowledged the rise
of new powers and a changing global power structure but has taken steps to reshape US foreign policy
structure accordingly. An important part of that has been recognising the importance of co-operating with
private and non-state actors such as NG0s, as well as dealing with non-state threats.
When the administration has called upon her to deliver tough messages, she has done so unflinchingly.
This has allowed the president to articulate a strategic vision which Clinton then goes about implementing.
Still, neither the secretary of state nor the president determines the global situation. The US may be the
most powerful country in the world but it is one among many powerful countries, and many aspects of the
situation we face today are beyond our control. The Obama administration has been dealt an extremely
difficult hand: not only Iraq and Afghanistan, but Iran and North Korea's nuclear programmes, the rise of
emerging powers and a complex and still unfolding series of financial crises.
We have gone from a world in which the US thought it had limitless resources and unbounded options to
one where the limits are clear; from a world in which you could work in the GB to one where you have to
work in the context of the G20; a world where new technologies and new powers play a bigger role. All of
those things would dictate a change in foreign policy regardless of who is in office.
Hillary Clinton has established a very solid foundation. The next step is to identify a couple of signature
issues - and have a couple of signature successes. That will take her to the next level.

At behest of PDT, I tried to call you just minutes ago to ask about your availability for phone call from him this afternoon.
-First choice: 5:00 p.m. (your time)
-Alternative: 7:00 p.m.
- If neither works for you, then propose time and we'll accomodate.
Two options to suggest:
1.With our individual cell phones, it is difficult to involve third person - to wit, me. Could you arrange for a confeiBi ce

2.Or as alternative, do you have capacity to call us separately to turn it into a conference call?
1.4(D)
Either option would not only make for a smoother conversation, but would also allow me to not have to be in same

so best that call be today.

A media update, CNN just called for a comment after the British rejected the letter. I told CNN that we
provided the team/delegation the waiver letter earlier this afternoon. I quoted from it that the waiver, which
applied to 28 individuals, was a limited authorization for departure from and re-entry in the United States. I
made clear during the briefing that even though we granted the waiver they needed to gain visas from the UK.
So, there is a sad ending to the story, but I also made clear during the briefing that the unique situation that
they found themselves in stemmed from their decision not to apply for a U.S. passport. I'll keep you updated
on the media play.

Subject: (Washington Post) Obama's worst foreign-policy mistake
By Mitt Romney
Tuesday, July 6, 2010
http://www.washingtonpost.comiwp-dyn/content/article/2010/07/05/AR2010070502657.html
Given President Obama's glaring domestic policy missteps, it is understandable that the public has largely been blinded
to his foreign policy failings. In fact, these may have been even more damaging to America's future. He fought to
reinstate Honduras's pro-Chavez president while stalling Colombia's favored-trade status. He castigated Israel at the
United Nations but was silent about Hamas having launched 7,000 rockets from the Gaza Strip. His policy of
""engagement"" with rogue nations has been met with North Korean nuclear tests, missile launches and the sinking of a
South Korean naval vessel, while Iran has accelerated its nuclear program, funded terrorists and armed Hezbollah with
long-range missiles. He acceded to Russia's No. 1 foreign policy objective, the abandonment of our Europe-based missile
defense program, and obtained nothing whatsoever in return.
Despite all of this, the president's New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New-START) with Russia could be his worst
foreign policy mistake yet. The treaty as submitted to the Senate should not be ratified.
New-START impedes missile defense, our protection from nuclear-proliferating rogue states such as Iran and North
Korea. Its preamble links strategic defense with strategic arsenal. It explicitly forbids the United States from converting
intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) silos into missile defense sites. And Russia has expressly reserved the right to
walk away from the treaty if it believes that the United States has significantly increased its missile defense capability.
Hence, to preserve the treaty's restrictions on Russia, America must effectively get Russia's permission for any missile
defense expansion. Moscow's vehemence over our modest plans in Eastern Europe demonstrate that such permission
would be extremely unlikely.
The treaty empowers a Bilateral Consultative Commission with broad latitude to amend the treaty with specific
reference to missile defense. New START does something the American public would never countenance and the Senate
should never permit: It jeopardizes our missile defense system.
The treaty also gives far more to the Russians than to the United States. As drafted, it lets Russia escape the limit on its
number of strategic nuclear warheads. Loopholes and lapses -- presumably carefully crafted by Moscow — provide a
path to entirely avoid the advertised warhead-reduction targets. For example, rail-based ICBMs and launchers are not
mentioned. Similarly, multiple nuclear warheads that are mounted on bombers are effectively not counted. Unlike past
treaty restrictions, ICBMs are not prohibited from bombers. This means that Russia is free to mount a nearly unlimited
number of ICBMs on bombers -- including MIRVs (multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles) or multiple
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05769454 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05769454 Date: 08/31/2015
warheads -- without tripping the treaty's limits. These omissions would be consistent with Russia's plans for a new heavy
bomber and reports of growing interest in rail-mobile ICBMs.
Under New START, the United States must drastically reduce our number of launchers but Russia will not -- it already has
fewer launchers than the treaty limits. Put another way: We give, Russia gets. And more troubling, the treaty fails to
apply the MIRV limits that were part of the prior START treaty. Again, it may not be coincidental that Russia is
developing a new heavy-load -- meaning MIRV-capable -- ICBM.
New-START gives Russia a massive nuclear weapon advantage over the United States. The treaty ignores tactical nuclear
weapons, where Russia outnumbers us by as much as 10 to 1. Obama heralds a reduction in strategic weapons from
approximately 2,200 to 1,550 but fails to mention that Russia will retain more than 10,000 nuclear warheads that are
categorized as tactical because they are mounted on missiles that cannot reach the United States. But surely they can
reach our allies, nations that depend on us for a nuclear umbrella. And who can know how those tactical nuclear
warheads might be reconfigured? Astonishingly, while excusing tactical nukes from the treaty, the Obama
administration bows to Russia's insistence that conventional weapons mounted on ICBMs are counted under the treaty's
warhead and launcher limits.
By all indications, the Obama administration has been badly out-negotiated. Perhaps the president's eagerness for
global disarmament led his team to accede to Russia's demands, or perhaps it led to a document that was less than
carefully drafted.
Whatever the reason for the treaty's failings, it must not be ratified: The security of the United States is at stake. The
only responsible course is for the Senate to demand and scrutinize the full diplomatic record underlying the treaty. Then
it must insist that any linkage between the treaty and our missile defense system be eliminated. In a world where
nuclear weapons are proliferating, America's missile defense shield must not be compromised. As currently drafted,
New START is a non-starter.

Re: Cameron Blowup in Europe .
Without: passing ""Go,"" David Cameron has seriously damaged his relations with the European leaders. Sending
a letter to Czech leader Vaclav Klaus encouraging him not to sign the Lisbon Treaty, as though Cameron were
already Prime Minister, he has offended Sarkozy, Merkel and Zapatero. Within the Conservative Party the
Shadow Foreign Minister William Hague has arduously pressured for an anti-EU stance, despite his assurances
to you that Tory policy toward Europe would be marked by continuity. Cameron has attempted to straddle
factions, fending off calls for a national referendum on the Lisbon Treaty. But this letter is proof positive of his
tilt to the Tory right on Europe. The European leaders understand that the letter signals his future policy and are
reacting accordingly. Cameron's presumptive strike has accelerated the predicted Tory-European split from
post-election to pre-election. Whether this affects Merkel's attitude on Blair and the EU presidency remains
unclear, but Cameron's high-handed behavior is precisely the sort of thing that provokes her. See the Guardian
report below:
Guardian
Europe leaders incensed by David Cameron's letter
Sarkozy, Merkel and Zapatero criticise Tories for attempt to-delay treaty
Niche: Watt and 1 anTi-aynor
Friday 30 October 2009 22.21 GMT
Leaders of three of the most powerful countries in Europe have strongly criticised David Cameron at the EU
summit over Conservative plans to scupper the Lisbon treaty.
Nicolas Sarkozy, Angela Merkel and Jose Luiz Rodriguez Zapatero are understood to have privately criticised
the Tory leader after he sent a handwritten letter to the Czech president Vaclav Klaus, who is refusing to sign
the treaty. The letter was seen as an attempt to influence the Czech Republic, the only country not to have
ratified the treaty.

Senior British sources familiar with thinking at the highest levels of the EU say that the leaders of France,
Germany and 5-_,ain all raised questions about the Cameron letter.
It is understood that Cameron encouraged Klaus to delay the ratification of the treaty by setting out Tory policy
to hold a referendum in Britain on the treaty if it has not been ratified by all member states.
The sources have told the Guardian that:
•Sarkozy was overheard telling Gordon Brown that he was incensed by Cameron's letter, which the French saw
as an attempt to wreck the Lisbon treaty.
•Merkel was also said to be upset by Cameron's letter. The German chancellor is understood to have echoed.
concerns of senior figures in her CDU party, such as the former European parliament president Hans Gert
Poettering, that Cameron's behaviour had been untrustworthy.
•Zapatero - who addressed the recent Labour party conference and will have to negotiate directly with
Cameron if he wins the election because Spain holds the EU's rotating presidency until July 2010 - made clear
to diplomats that he regarded Cameron's letter as damaging and an attempt to scupper the treaty.
The interventions by the EU leaders come as the Tories plan to abandon their two-year campaign to hold a
referendum on the Lisbon treaty. Senior Tories told the Guardian that Cameron will set out his thinking in the
coming weeks if, as expected, the Czech President finally ratifies the treaty.
It is understood that Cameron will drop his pledge to hold a referendum on the treaty on the grounds that it is
impossible to open a treaty that has entered EU law. A Tory government would instead focus on repatriating
social and employment laws, in effect restoring the British opt-out from the social chapter. This has been
sprinkled around various EU treaties since Tony Blair ended the opt-out in 1997, meaning that its measures
could only be restored to Britain with the agreement of all member states.
Brown yesterday used his appearance at the summit, where he held a series of formal and informal one-to-one
meetings with EU leaders, to launch a strong attack on the Tories' approach to Europe. Speaking of the Tory
decision to abandon the main centre-right EPP grouping in the European parliament in favour of a smaller
group consisting mainly of fringe parties from the hard right in eastern Europe, the prime minister said: ""The
Conservative party are standing apart from the mainstream in Europe..
""They are part of a very small group of minorities - of 23 people apart from the Conservative party. They are
standing on the fringes of Europe. That is a huge mistake for British interests.""
A Tory spokeswoman said: ""We have never concealed the fact that we sent the letter David Cameron has
made no secret of its contents. It sets out his public opinion in a private letter.""

Re: Iran, Saudi
Had dinner last night (Tuesday, February 16) with Joschka Fischer. We had an interesting conversation on Iran
and Saudi Arabia, among other things. (As you know Fischer is now director of the Nabucco pipeline project.)
On Iran, harsh, targeted sanctions are absolutely necessary, but are most effective diplomatically when always
coupled with an offer to negotiate. The iron fist in the velvet glove approach achieves several objectives:
According to Fischer's intelligence, Ahmanijehad wished some negotiated settlement but was blocked. The
regime has splits at the top. Perhaps true, perhaps not. But constantly pushing negotiations alongside sanctions
puts additional pressure on internal divisions, whatever they are. Extending an open hand while brandishing a
stick closes diplomatic and political room to maneuver for Iran: Its refusal to accept the open hand justifies
application of the stick. Even when sanctions are enforced it always remains useful to say another way is open.
The damage done to Iran is therefore the result of its own choice. This approach also aids the opposition. A
purely condign sanctions strategy can contribute to the regime's will to punish and tighten repression. Talking
of regime change, of course, undermines the cause of regime change. It is a gift to the regime. The opposition is
a new factor in the Iran equation that must be taken into account on the political and moral level. Pushed to the
wall, the regime may feel compelled to repress, which might involve thousands or tens of thousands of political
killings. On Saudi Arabia, Fischer points out that if Iran develops nuclear weaponry the Saudis already have
their own bomb. The Saudis invested in Pakistan's nuclear weaponry partly for this eventuality; that's their
bomb in reserve.

HRC,
As of April 21st Dave Stone's former business partner ( James F. Blom ), and I will establish 'Stone Harbour,LLC' (named
for Dave) in Delaware. This will be a nice merger of Dave's and my contacts. Apart from the ongoing vetting of Simon
Stringer's multi purpose software, at several levels, I am keen to help in the human trafficking effort. I have been in
touch with Sharyn Magarian (keeping Kris B informed) in seeking the status of that effort, as I am quite sure the combo
of Dave's former contacts and mine can help. Jim Blom has already spoken to several (Oracle Corp and his friends in
Silicon Valley) and they too are motivated. Work is work, but the human trafficking issue seems like the right thing to do.
All the best, Marty

Northern Ireland power-sharing deal was announced. Photograph: Julien Behal/PA
Justice and policing powers will be devolved to Northern Ireland <http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/northernireland> 's
power-sharing government from 12 April in a historic deal agreed by the main parties that ""opens a new chapter"" after
decades of violence, Gordon Brown said today.
Standing alongside his Irish counterpart, Brian Cowen, at a press conference at Hillsborough Castle outside Belfast, the
prime minister said the ""inspirational"" agreement between Sinn Fein <http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/sinn-fein>
and the Democratic Unionist party (DUP) <http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/dup> was a foundation for lasting peace.
The deal — finally agreed to by the DUP <http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2010/feb/05/northern-ireland-dup-ulster-
deal> last night and described as a final piece in the jigsaw after a long search for peace — comes after two weeks of
round-the-clock negotiations and brings an end to fears that the power-sharing government might collapse.
It will see policing and justice powers devolved from Westminster to the assembly within weeks and includes new plans
on overseeing parades.
Brown, who travelled to Belfast this morning, said the agreement had been possible because of ""a new spirit of mutual
co-operation and respect"".
The deal meets a key Sinn Fein demand and prevents the republican party from walking out of the power-sharing
executive. In return, the DUP has secured reforms to the way loyalist marches are handled in Northern Ireland, including
the abolition of the Parades Commission, a body most unionists regard as biased in favour of nationalists.
A cross-community vote will now be held in the Stormont assembly on 9 March before the policing and justice powers
are devolved from London on 12 April.
Brown told reporters: ""The achievements have been as great as they are inspirational. This moment and this agreement
belongs to the people of Northern Ireland, all of the people, and now more than ever before so does their future ... This
is the last chapter of a long and troubled story and the beginning of a new chapter after decades of violence, years of
talks, weeks of stalemate.""
Cowen praised both unionists and nationalists for making ""fair and balanced compromises"" to bridge the divisions and
said the quality of the negotiations meant that the ""devolved institutions can and will work"".
The Northern Ireland secretary, Shaun Woodward, said the deal would further isolate republican dissidents who have
launched three separate gun and bomb attacks against police stations in the province over the last 10 days. The deal
would ""absolutely"" make Northern Ireland a safer place, he said.
The DUP leader, Peter Robinson, said the agreement ""will be more enduring because of the time spent"" in forming it.
Referring back to the Belfast Agreement of 1998 <http://www.nio.gov.uk/the-agreement> when negotiations bore fruit
at the 11th hour, the Sinn Fein president, Gerry Adams, described the current deal and the rescue of power-sharing as
""yet another very good Friday"".
Jeffrey Donaldson told the Guardian the DUP's 36-strong assembly team was now unanimously in favour of the deal.
But the Ulster Unionist party (UUP) has yet to officially back the package which will allow the assembly to set up
legislation to change the way parades are judged.
A UUP spokeswoman said members wanted to see the proposed agreement before giving their response to the two
governments. ""We have not had sight of this agreement and until we do we will not be signing up to it,"" she said.
The talks, which centred on Hillsborough Castle, outside Belfast, are the longest set of continuous negotiations held in
the near 20-year peace process. Sinn Fein had accused the DUP of stalling on the transfer of policing powers for the last
three years and it was feared that failure to find agreement could see the collapse of the power-sharing government led
by the two parties.
The agreement finally came near midnight at Stormont's parliament building. Earlier in the evening Sinn Fein had said
the basis of a deal was on the table and it was giving the DUP leadership the time to persuade its party to accept it.

Robinson emerged from a meeting of party colleagues to confirm that he had secured unanimous support for the
proposals. Earlier in the week up to 14 DUP assembly members had opposed a proposed deal because it did not give
unionists enough concessions.
Robinson said he would now look to gain the support of the community and the smaller assembly parties for the deal.
""We have a basis upon which we can go forward and recommend it [the deal] to our party, to the other parties in
Northern Ireland and to the community.
""An essential element of the Democratic Unionist Party's manifesto is the requirement for community confidence; we
believe this can be the basis for gaining that confidence.""
However the leader of the hardline Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV), Jim Allister, questioned why the 14 DUP rebels had
changed their minds.
""The deal hasn't changed, only the snowmen of the DUP, who melted once the heat came on,"" Allister said.
The DUP now faces a struggle to ward off the TUV threat in the forthcoming general election. Allister will portray the
deal as a sell-out of unionist principles and a sop to republicanism.

Happy New Year. I hope you got some time to enjoy the holiday season and could relax before getting back at it this
year.
Andy Young is a very good friend of mine, and has been a stalwart for the Clintons over the years. He is also one of the
most recognized and respected experts on Africa in America. He asked me today if I thought it would be appropriate for
him to seek to see the Secretary to share some of his thoughts on Africa and current issues being confronted there. I
told him of course and suggested that he reach out to you to try to arrange that dialogue. Hopefully that is ok from your
perspective. Andy is a thoughtful, remarkable and decent man. If you don't know him you will enjoy getting to know
him. Thanks and maybe one of these days when I am in DC we can grab a coffee together. Cheers.

fyi: Blair's chances seem to be cratering in EU. Sid
Tony lair's bid for EU residency sinks
Ex-PM's chances of winning role slide as Sarkozy and Merkel fail to back him
• Nicholas s‘tv'at.i. and )an,..Trajf.pf in Brussels
• u!,-„ Thursday 29 October 2009 21.26 GMT
T20.,.:31::.3.1:7's hopes of becoming Europe's first sitting president were receding fast tonight as Britain admitted his chances
of success were ""fading"" after the continent's centre-right leaders made it clear one of their own must have the post.
Hours after G
.nr.4,
,efl Srov.,,h delivered his strongest statement of support for Blair — disclosing that he had spoken to him
earl;er this week — British sources indicated that the former prime minister was unlikely to assume the high-profile. job.
""it would be right to describe Tony's c,hances as fading,"" one British source said.""..slcgles. t.
..aa'r.sa; and are
not terribly enthusiastic. Silvio Berlust.-,oni remains his strongest backer.""
Bialr's expected failure to secure the post of president of the European Council meant that ca,•,-,'et.,
..""it;ity.n-te was emerging
as a serious contender to assume the new post of high representative for foreign policy. The foreign secretary insisted,
however, that.he was ""not available"".
Miliband spoke out as British sources said it had become clear in recent days that Blair would struggle to become
president. The post is likely to be filled in the next month amid signs that the Czech Republic will become the last EU
country to ratify the Lisbon treaty.
Sarkozy, the French president, and Merkel, the German chancellor, are understood to have agreed at a dinner at the
Elysee Palace last night that the new president should be appointed from the main centre-right EPP grouping, which
brings together the parties currently ruling most EU countries.
Brown gave a hint at a press conference that Blair's candidacy was fading when he qualified his strong backing for his
predecessor by stating that there were also other candidates for the job. ""Of course it may not happen and there are other
candidates as well,"" he said.
The prime minister's remarks came after he attended an acrimonious meeting of the European centre-left leaders this
afternoon, shortly before the EU summit in Brussels began.
Brown was understood to have had a tense exchange with Martin Schulz, the German leader of the Socialists in the
European parliament, who wants the left to assume the new foreign policy post, leaving the presidency to the centre right.
Brown told the meeting: ""You need to get real. This is a unique opportunity to get a progressive politician to be the
president of the council.""
But it soon became clear that Blair has no support on the left, let alone on the centre right. Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero,
Spain's centre-left prime minister, for the first time publicly queried the Blair candidacy by announcing that the centre left
across the EU was more concerned with securing the other post of European foreign minister. Zapatero, who will have to
work with the new European figureheads when Spain assumes the Eti's six-month rotating presidency on 1 January, said
the European socialists were clear that they want the post of the high representative. ""There is a preference for the high
representative,"" he said. ""That is rather reasonable.""
A senior Spanish official said this was the first time that Zapatero had ""dropped Blair"" and that the centre-left in the EU
was seeking a deal with the centre-right, led by Merkel. The centre-right would get the job coveted by Blair, while the
centre left would take the foreign minister post. The lack of support for Blair became clear when Jean Asselborn,
Luxembourg's foreign minister, launched a strong attack on him as be emerged from the meeting of Socialist leaders. ""lt is
not about the person of Tony Blair. Now in the United States, Obama is the president, it is no more Mr Bush. We have a
new treaty, we have to reset Europe and we need to start with some new ideas. There is and will remain a link for the next
generation between Iraq, Bush and Tony Blair.""
Downing Street wiil resist criticism that it was wrong to mount such a strong campaign in favour of Blair when it had
become clear earlier this week that his chances were fading.
Brown believes it was right — and in the national interest — to argue strongly for Blair when there was a chance to secure
such a senior post for Britain. Blair, who had a tense relationship with Brown during his decade as prime minister, will be
pleased by the strength of his successor's support.
Brown said today: ""Let me say very clear that we, the British government, believe that Tony Blair would be an excellent
candidate and an excellent person to hold the job of president of the council.
""His international experience is well known, his expertise on environmental, economic and security issues is well known to
everybody throughout Europe as well as known throughout the world If you have the chance for that to happen it is in
Britain's national interest.""

Strategic Communications
First, let me say how shocked we all were by the news over the weekend. I know this is a very difficult time for everyone
at the Mission and our thoughts are with all of you.
I had a good conversation with Jim Williams about the strategic communications initiative and I wanted to bring you up
to speed on our thinking and where things stand with Keith.
Based on our discussions and the excellent paper that Jim prepared I think there are several critical areas that we need
to address:
• Work with our counterparts in the Mexican government to help them develop their capacity to handle the
communications aspects of the drug initiative more effectively
• Develop a process for ensuring the GOM and USG have clear, coordinated and consistent messaging on all
aspects of the initiative
• Increase public awareness in Mexico about ""Merida"" ; based on a report I got from INR last week there is very
little awareness or understanding of the program in Mexico and the contributions of USG
• Work with GOM to develop an on-going and effective communications strategy at all levels to provide people
across the country with information that is directly relevant to them and which they need to navigate their way
through this crisis. For example, what is going on in their community; what are local authorities doing; what
programs are available in their schools; what can they do, etc. I have increasingly come to believe that the lack
of this sort of ""personally relevant"" information at a time of crisis increases public anxiety and contributes to the
overall sense of things being out of control. We have begun to focus on this issue and have worked both in Haiti
and last year in Pakistan to provide people with a steady stream of information they can use. We are using a
wide array of communications tools to deliver these messages that allows the information to be delivered in a
very granular ,local, personal way. The other benefit of this approach is that it helps balance the steady stream
of gruesome news being put out by traditional media.
• Work with private sector in both Mexico and US to develop broad based PSA campaign to increase awareness of
the initiative and maintain public support for the effort
• Increase awareness in Mexico of USG efforts to combat drug use in US
Keith has reached out to a number of his associates at BDA and unfortunately he has met with some resistance to BDA
taking this project on. The personal safety issue seems to be the biggest concern. I do believe we will be able to
overcome this to some degree and I have some ideas which we can discuss when we next speak. In the meantime I have
reached out to Pat Mitchell of the Paley Center and she believes she will be able to help engage the US private sector
once we have a plan of action in place.
Finally, with regard to next week's trip by S, Jim feels it might be better for me to come to Mexico sometime in late April
rather than have it as part of next week's agenda. I am happy to do whatever works best for you. Keith is also prepared
to come next week or in April. Just let us know.

Strategic Communications
First, let me say how shocked we all were by the news over the weekend. I know this is a very difficult time for everyone
at the Mission and our thoughts are with all of you.
I had a good conversation with Jim Williams about the strategic communications initiative and I wanted to bring you up
to speed on our thinking and where things stand with Keith.
Based on our discussions and the excellent paper that Jim prepared I think there are several critical areas that we need
to address:
• Work with our counterparts in the Mexican government to help them develop their capacity to handle the
communications aspects of the drug initiative more effectively
• Develop a process for ensuring the GOM and USG have clear, coordinated and consistent messaging on all
aspects of the initiative
• Increase public awareness in Mexico about ""Merida"" ; based on a report I got from INR last week there is very
little awareness or understanding of the program in Mexico and the contributions of USG
• Work with GOM to develop an on-going and effective communications strategy at all levels to provide people

through this crisis. For example, what is going on in their community; what are local authorities doing; what

Subject: Brief memo for Cheryl Mills on Colombia - for Secretary Clinton
Dear Cheryl —
In my last email (Friday, 5/28), I attached the letter from the bipartisan Co-Chairs and
Executive Committee members of the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission sent to Assistant
Secretary Mike Posner expressing grave concern about the recent rise in death threats, attacks
and murders of Colombian human rights defenders, religious, community and other NGO
leaders. Congressman McGovern also strongly encouraged the Secretary to meet with
representatives of those organizations and individuals being threatened, with a particularly
effort to reach out to and invite the Bishops of Tumaco (Narifio), Barrancabermeja/Medio
Magdalena (Santander), and we would now add Putumayo, since the Colombian Catholic Church
just advised us yesterday of increased death threats against religious workers there. In addition, we
recommended inviting Monsetior Hector Fabio Henao, director of Pastoral Social, at the
Archdiocese in Bogota, who represents all the pastoral work of the Church throughout the country,
as well as representatives from the Mennonite and Lutheran churches, in particular.
While in Colombia, the most important thing the Secretary can do is avoid effusive praise
for President Alvaro Uribe, who leaves office in August. Inside Colombia, the visit by the
Secretary is being described as focusing solely on the free trade agreement and continuing support
of the counterdrug strategy/Plan Colombia. Without changes in the human rights situation and the
culture of impunity, it is unlikely that anything the Secretary might say or do will alter the equation
on Capitol Hill regarding the trade agreement. It should be noted that the October 2008 GAO
report on the counter-drug operations in Colombia concluded that U.S. assistance was successful in
increasing security in parts of the country, but a failure in the areas of counter-narcotics (GAO-09-
71) and a subsequent April 2009 USAID evaluation on U.S. aid for Plan Colombia for illegal crop
reduction and Colombian countemarcotics policies actually contribute to increased coca
production.
The Colombian president has been a solid backer of U.S. policy and U.S. interests in the
region, and has achieved some important improvements in the country's security situation. It is
important to recognize that, but to do so without repeating the tone of Defense Secretary Gates'
April visit, in which he called Uribe a ""great hero"" and failed even to mention any concerns.
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05769638 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05769638 Date: 08/31/2015
These concerns are of critical importance, and while the Secretary need not list them all, at
least some deserve public acknowledgement — some recognition that it is important to the United
States that Colombia, including the current government and its successor, show the necessary
political will to deal with them:
• A sharp rise in alleged military killings of civilians. In many cases, these are so-called ""false
positives"": non-combatants murdered and later presented as members of armed groups killed
in combat. These, notes UN Special Rapporter for Extrajudicial Executions Philip Alston,
""began occurring with a disturbing frequency across Colombia from 2004."" Citing
prosecutors' and NGOs' reports, Alston indicates that Colombia's security forces may have
killed 1,486 civilians during the first six years of Alvaro Uribe's presidency. Alston notes
that the Defense Ministry only began to address the situation after the media broke the story
of the false-positives and the subsequent negative publicity and horrified public outcry.
The prosecution of ""false positives"" is moving with excruciating slowness. In perhaps the
most notorious case — the murders of about twenty young men from the poor Bogota suburb
of Soacha — nearly all of the accused soldiers and officers have been released from prison,
pending trial, as deadlines for timely prosecution have run out. Since their arrest in late 2008,
their case has been prolonged by numerous delaying tactics by the defense, including
attempts to have their cases tried in the military court system as ""acts of service."" Alston
reports that the impunity rate on these extrajudicial murders by security forces may be as
high as 98.5 percent.
• Mounting allegations that the President's intelligence service, the DAS, was put at the
service of paramilitary leaders and narcotraffickers; used to spy on and intimidate Supreme
Court justices, opposition politicians, journalists and human rights defenders; and employed
in a campaign of sabotage and smears against political opponents.
Prosecutors are alleging that the orders to have the DAS carry out wiretaps, surveillance and
""political warfare"" came from high up in the Colombian presidency, though the question of
""what President Uribe knew, and when he knew it"" remains unanswered. Meanwhile efforts
to reform or dissolve the DAS are stalled in Colombia's Congress.
• President Uribe's political coalition has also been hit by a scandal known in Colombia
as ""para-politics."" This coalition has included dozens of political bosses from regions
beyond the capital. Many are large landholders with ties to narcotrafficking, the same local
leaders who created and fostered the brutal pro-government paramilitary groups that killed
tens of thousands of non-combatants in the 1990s and early 2000s.
Evidence, much of it from former paramilitary leaders, has brought about 300 criminal
investigations against legislators, governors, mayors and other local officials, nearly all of
them Alvaro Uribe's political supporters, who made common cause with the far-right
warlords. To date, of the 278 congresspeople and senators elected in 2006, 68 are under
official investigation, on trial, or convicted for paramilitary ties. Those embroiled in
parapolitics include the President's cousin, Mario Uribe; the brother of his former foreign

minister; and individuals whom the President had named to be Colombia's ambassadors to
Chile, the Dominican Republic, and Canada.
The Colombian prosecutors, investigators, witnesses and non-governmental organizations
trying to uncover the truth about these abuses are working under conditions of great personal risk.
They, too, are heroes and would benefit greatly from a public expression of concern about the
cases they are investigating, and a reminder that their work is legitimate and important to
U.S. interests in Colombia.
At the same time, it is important to avoid appearing to endorse any candidate in the June
20 runoff elections. Between the first and second rounds of a country' s presidential election is a
politically awkward time for a high-level official visit. Though President Uribe's former defense
minister, Juan Manuel Santos, is the overwhelming favorite given his margin of success in the May
301first round of balloting over former Bogota mayor Antanas Mockus, it is necessary at this stage
to convey a sense of balance and a willingness to work closely with whoever wins. As a result, any
kind words for one candidate should be balanced by praise for the other.
Finally, it would be helpful to remind the Colombian people that the United States
supports a peaceful resolution of Bogota's worsening differences with Venezuela. While
President Chavez' s behavior is a significant concern, it would be most unhelpful to be perceived on
this trip as fanning the flames of conflict with Colombia — or playing into the Chavez rhetoric that
the U.S. and Colombia have military aspirations in the region.
Hope this memo, along with last week's copy of the TLHRC letter to Assistant Secretary
Posner, are helpful and useful materials for the Secretary as she plans her trip.
Very best wishes —
On behalf of Cong. Jim McGovern

Germany in Need of a Dream
By JOHN KORNBLUM
Has Germany abandoned Europe? Do Angela Merkel's tough conditions for aid to Greece mean that Germany is no
longer the motor of European integration? Has Frau Merkel in fact morphed from the Miss Europa of 2007 to the Fraulein
Germania of 2010, as Germany's own former foreign minister Joschka Fischer has suggested?
As a former American ambassador who has lived arid worked the better part of four decades around Germany, my
Blackberry often glows red hot with messages from persons asking these questions. My response is always the same:
Germany has changed very little, but Europe and the world have changed a lot. Therein lies the dilemma.
Germany has worked hard to dig its way out of the disaster of 1945, but trauma remains a defining issue for German
society. Sixty five years later, Germany is still focused on the three essentials of its recovery: stability, respectability and
peace. Keep this triangle in mind and lots of things quickly come into focus.
From the first days of the Federal Republic. Germany's leaders emphasized the importance of defining interests solely
within a common European and Atlantic vocation. But they also understood that renouncing national ambitions did not
remove the responsibility to pursue specific German goals through the common institutions.
Many important postwar accomplishments were conceived and pushed by Germany, sometimes over the opposition of
others — including the United States. Ostpolitik was controversial for years, as was NATO enlargement. Germany pushed
them with determination.
Helmut Kohl did not consult before promulgating his 10 points on reunification. He agreed to French desires for a common
currency, but only if it could be a mirror of the Deutsche mark, for decades the European monetary standard. The euro
stability pact, now the object of so much controversy with Greece, was the result. After 1990, the E.U.'s eastward
expansion was Germany's way of firming up its Eastern flank.
Slowly and without fanfare, Germany has been remaking the European Union in its image. At each step of the way,
Germany made its wishes more palatable by paying more than its share. Part of today's misunderstanding is caused by
Germany's success in using its contributions to build an image of selflessness. Germany has been as single-minded in
pursuit of its goals as Charles de Gaulle ever was for his, but it almost always left leadership to others.
A new consciousness grew after the costs of reunification began to mount. ""Europe"" in the institutional sense has become
increasingly unpopular. German courts have begun to define German European issues in the context of the German
Constitution rather than on the basis of E.U. law. At least some of Ms. Merkel's refusal to allow immediate assistance to
Greece was based on her fears that it would fan anti-E.U. sentiment at home. Are these the first signs of a German Tea
Party?
Here we find the source of most of the hand wringing about Germany's role as the ""motor of Europe."" Ms. Merkel's
unwillingness to sweeten the financial pot echoed throughout Brussels. To many, it signified the decline of German
willingness to ""salute the French flag three times before raising the German flag,"" as Konrad Adenauer used to put it.
Germans are not alone in objecting to throwing more money into the E.U. pot, but they happen to be the only ones who
can do something about it. Many fear that without German complaisance, the E.U. will stutter to a stop. But such self-
denial could never offer a viable foundation for a new Europe. Neither could the inefficiency and even corruption that
characterizes many E.U. programs.
Most maddening for most thinking Europeans is the knowledge that the Germans are right. But to them, the question is
whether Germany is remaking the E.U. in a fashion palatable to the majority of other member states. They are not so sure
that its focus on stability and accountability is the right way to help such a diverse collection of peoples adjust to a
globalized world.
And so when Angela Merkel raps Greek knuckles, she is sending a message most Europeans don't want to hear. Not that
Germany is dangerous; even worse, that it is unrelenting. The Neue aricher Zeitung probably spoke for many others
when it once accused Germany of wanting Europe to become a large Switzerland.
The growing gap between Germany's aspirations and the perceived needs of other members of the E.U. is beginning to
burden both sides. Most Europeans are simply not ready to live up to German standards. Without a more flexible sense of
common purpose, the project to build a democratic Europe could stop dead in the water. But as Germans will themselves
often tell you: They have forgotten how to dream.
Younger Germans feel this lack of inspiration as well. Dreams were what 200,000 of them were waiting to hear when they
rallied to hear Barack Obama in Berlin two summers ago. They wanted more than to ""Dare to Hope,"" which is the
characteristically timid German translation of the title of the president's best seller. And they are still waiting. America
seems busy elsewhere.
The main conclusion I draw from the debate about Germany is that it is not about Germany at all. The task of building a
democratic Europe is far from complete. Most of the foundations have been laid and now the residents are starting to
haggle over the design. Weaving today's 27 states into a true trans-Atlantic partnership is a task that is too big for
Germany or even Europe to accomplish alone. They desperately need some skilled architectural assistance.
Uniting Europe and North America is the most audacious project ever conceived. If it works, the United States will be
joined by nearly 500 million Europeans to form a democratic space, within which modern democratic values will harness
more energy than in any single nation on earth. Democracy's future as the operating system for a globalized world will be
assured.
European fecklessness seems to worry Washington officials these days. But if Germany has forgotten how to dream and
the United States is too busy to try, we will both be guilty of perpetuating the aimlessness we so criticize. To hold up its
side of the bargain, Europe needs exactly what Barack Obama originally promised — the audacity of hope.

Germany in Need of a Dream
By JOHN KORNBLUM
Has Germany abandoned Europe? Do Angela Merkel's tough conditions for aid to Greece mean that Germany is no
longer the motor of European integration? Has Frau Merkel in fact morphed from the Miss Europa of 2007 to the Fraulein
Germania of 2010, as Germany's own former foreign minister Joschka Fischer has suggested?
As a former American ambassador who has lived arid worked the better part of four decades around Germany, my
Blackberry often glows red hot with messages from persons asking these questions. My response is always the same:
Germany has changed very little, but Europe and the world have changed a lot. Therein lies the dilemma.
Germany has worked hard to dig its way out of the disaster of 1945, but trauma remains a defining issue for German
society. Sixty five years later, Germany is still focused on the three essentials of its recovery: stability, respectability and
peace. Keep this triangle in mind and lots of things quickly come into focus.
From the first days of the Federal Republic. Germany's leaders emphasized the importance of defining interests solely
within a common European and Atlantic vocation. But they also understood that renouncing national ambitions did not
remove the responsibility to pursue specific German goals through the common institutions.
Many important postwar accomplishments were conceived and pushed by Germany, sometimes over the opposition of
others — including the United States. Ostpolitik was controversial for years, as was NATO enlargement. Germany pushed
them with determination.
Helmut Kohl did not consult before promulgating his 10 points on reunification. He agreed to French desires for a common
currency, but only if it could be a mirror of the Deutsche mark, for decades the European monetary standard. The euro
stability pact, now the object of so much controversy with Greece, was the result. After 1990, the E.U.'s eastward
expansion was Germany's way of firming up its Eastern flank.

• The Secretary's Possible Phone Call with Egyptian President Mubarak
TBD
Background: S/E Mitchell met with Foreign Minister Aboul Gheit and EGIS Chief
Omar Solimon on January 24 in Cairo. While Solimon responded positively to S/E
Mitchell's request that Egypt encourage Palestinian President Abbas to agree to
proximity talks, Aboul Gheit asserted that the Palestinians should not agree to any
form of negotiations until Israel has taken action on the ""five steps"" requested by
the Palestinians. Aboul Gheit then hosted a meeting on February 3 with
Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat and Jordanian FM Nasser Judeh, which Solimon
attended in part. Egypt and Jordan agreed to support the Palestinians entry into
proximity talks, but the three sides also agreed that Abbas would seek U.S. views
on two questions: 1) The terms of reference for the proximity talks and 2) Whether
the U.S. would present its own bridging proposals on final status issues or simply
serve as a conduit for the parties' positions. Deputy Envoy David Hale met with
Abbas on February 5, during which Abbas indicated flexibility on both the terms
of reference (he would accept a general formula based on language from the
Roadmap) and on the U.S. role. You should emphasize that it is critical that
Abbas agree to begin proximity talks immediately to lay the foundation for
negotiations that will realize Palestinian aspirations for an independent and
viable state.

summit sidelines
Climate talks overshadowed by divisive subject of Tony Blair's candidacy to be Europe's first president
European government chiefs gather in Brussels this evening for a summit likely to be the first occasion to broach the
divisive subject of Tony Blair's candidacy to be Europe's first president.
The topic is not formally on the agenda of a meeting that will be dominated by wrangling over climate change funding and
how to get the Czech president, Vaclav Klaus, to add the final signature to the reformist Lisbon treaty. But senior
diplomats predicted there would be intense private discussion on the fringes of the summit over the question: who will get
the plum job of first sitting president of the European council, the pre-eminent EU forum that brings leaders together for
summits at least four times a year.
David Miliband, the foreign secretary, said today that Blair would give Europe a ""strong voice"" on the global stage, but his
comments were seized on by his Conservative shadow, William Hague, who said the debate over the presidency proved
that the UK should have held a referendum on the Lisbon treaty.
Officially, the job does not exist until Klaus finalises Czech ratification of the treaty, expected within weeks. While Blair
personally has kept quiet about his ambitions, the British government is campaigning increasingly assertively on the
former prime minister's behalf.
""We will be making the case for a strong, internationally known figure who can open doors in [foreign] capitals,"" said an
official. ""There is only one candidate.""
That was not a reference to Jean-Claude Juncker, the veteran Luxembourg prime minister and European fixer, who is the
only contender so far to have openly declared his candidacy. He emerged this week as the anti-Blair.
Juncker looks certain to fail in his bid for the top job. But he may well succeed in destroying Blair's chances, being viewed
as a stalking horse who will vanish to make way for a third unknown contender.
While the Blair debate rages on the sidelines of the summit, the big priority for the Swedish government chairing the
meeting is to try to break a deadlock on EU funding of climate change programmes in the developing world ahead of the
Copenhagen conference in December.
Berlin and Warsaw are the keys to a deal, but the prospects for a breakthrough look dim. Fredrik Reinfeldt, the Swedish
prime minister, warned that Europe's credibility on global warming was at stake.
In recent weeks European governments have locked horns over the financing package and have been unable to reach
agreement. The aim is to come up with pledges of an EU fund of up to €15bn (£13.4bn) a year by 2020 for transfers to the
developing countries to combat global warming. The overall package is central to a Copenhagen deal.
But with the other big players, especially the US, which is reluctant to commit to a figure, Germany believes Europe
should not show its hand until the Copenhagen negotiations. The European commission and others such as the UK and
the Scandinavians believe agreeing on a figure in advance would strengthen Europe's global leadership role on climate
change and send a strong signal to other potential signatories.
The Poles and other eastern Europeans are unhappy at being asked to stump up for developing countries such as Brazil,
which is wealthier than the poorer EU members. The Poles are refusing to agree a package and figures for Copenhagen
unless it is first decided how the bill will be split among the EU's 27 governments. In the midst of a financial crisis, the
eastern Europeans say they cannot afford the climate change fund.
Angela Merkel, sworn in yesterday for a second term as German chancellor, will be pivotal to any climate change
financing deal and her answer to the Blair question may also be decisive. So far, she has been hedging her bets.
While Nicolas Sarkozy, the French president, is known to support Blair with reservations, there are no German candidates
for the two big new jobs being created under Lisbon — the European president and a European foreign minister or high
representative for foreign and security policy.
In Paris last night the French and German leaders discussed the posts, although there was little information on whether
they reached a pact. Sarkozy said the two leaders agreed on ""almost everything"".
Austria, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg — all said to nurse ambitions to secure the presidential post
themselves — have come out publicly against Blair on the grounds that he would neglect the interests of smaller EU
member states — 19 out of the total 27.
Adding his voice to the argument, Demitris Christofias, the president of Cyprus, said a council president ""from a small
country would be more objective and more consensual. The European Union is a family of compromises.""
The Dutch centre-right prime minister and possible contender, Jan-Peter Balkenende, has come under pressure this week
to renounce European presidential ambitions since his move to Brussels could trigger early elections and the fall of his
government.
Christofias emphasised that tonight the priority would be to get the Klaus blocking of the Lisbon treaty lifted rather than
focusing on who gets what under Lisbon.
Senior diplomats agreed it was too early to discuss names. If Klaus signs thetreaty soon, a special summit would be
convened next month to decide on the president and foreign minister, also leaving the European commission chief, Jose
Manuel Barroso, to put together a new team.","UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05767474 Date: 07/31/2015

for the two big new jobs being created under Lisbon — the European president and a European foreign minister or high
representative for foreign and security policy.
In Paris last night the French and German leaders discussed the posts, although there was little information on whether
they reached a pact. Sarkozy said the two leaders agreed on ""almost everything"".
Austria, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg — all said to nurse ambitions to secure the presidential post
themselves — have come out publicly against Blair on the grounds that he would neglect the interests of smaller EU
member states — 19 out of the total 27.
Adding his voice to the argument, Demitris Christofias, the president of Cyprus, said a council president ""from a small
country would be more objective and more consensual. The European Union is a family of compromises.""
The Dutch centre-right prime minister and possible contender, Jan-Peter Balkenende, has come under pressure this week
to renounce European presidential ambitions since his move to Brussels could trigger early elections and the fall of his
government.
Christofias emphasised that tonight the priority would be to get the Klaus blocking of the Lisbon treaty lifted rather than
focusing on who gets what under Lisbon.
Senior diplomats agreed it was too early to discuss names. If Klaus signs thetreaty soon, a special summit would be
convened next month to decide on the president and foreign minister, also leaving the European commission chief, Jose
Manuel Barroso, to put together a new team.

4997,C05769380,LESSONS FROM THE ACEH AND NIAS MULTI-DONOR TRUST FUND,,,,,,,,"UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05769380 Date: 08/31/2015

Lessons from the Aceh and Nias Multi-Donor Trust Fund
1. The Government of Indonesia (G01) responded to the Tsunami by issuing a series of
government decrees, and immediately organized both overview and relief efforts to
ensure a rational and coordinated response. The first task was to produce a Damage and
Loss Assessment (DLA). The DLA was followed by a more detailed Master Plan for
Rehabilitation and Reconstruction (MPRR). The MPRR provided in-depth sector plans,
spatial planning, the governance and supervision arrangements of finances with
considerable attention to how to avoid or minimize corruption. The process behind the
MPRR was consultative, with a wide range of local stakeholders and public offices being
heard. The MPRR was presented on 26 March, only 3 months after the Tsunami.
2. The MPRR was to form the basis for a general three-stage strategy. The Relief phase was
originally set to six months, but was then reduced to three: January- March 2005. The
Rehabilitation phase is to run for about 21 months, through December 2006, and the
Reconstruction phase from July 2006 through December 2009. The MPRR provides a
well defined phasing of interventions.
3. The objectives for the Relief efforts were humanitarian relief: rescue; food and
medicine; emergency infrastructure and temporary shelter; and burying the dead. The
Rehabilitation phase is to restore services to minimum level: public services; economic
facilities; banking and financial institutions; trauma treatments; secure land rights; law
and order; and temporary shelter. Finally, Reconstruction is to rebuild the region:
rebuilding the economy (production, trade and banking); the transportation,
telecommunications, and social and cultural systems; improving institutional capacity;
and housing.
4. The Government set up a ministerial-level agency to manage the MPRR program from
Aceh itself, the Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Agency for Aceh and Nias. The BRR
was formally established end April 2005 and became operational early May. The World
Bank Board on 30 March 2005 formally established the Multi-Donor Trust Fund (MDF)
with a Steering Committee comprised of BRR, GOI, donors and civil society. Having a
credible local coordinators was key to success.
5. The EC channels nearly 93% of its funds through the MDF, while only 2.5% of USD 400
million from the US goes to the MDF. While payments into the fund were slow,
disbursements out of it were to begin with even slower. By October 2005, project
agreements for about USD 200 million had been signed, but only USD 3 million had

actually been disbursed. Disbursements picked up the pace thereafter. The delay was
caused by two principal impediments: first, donors were quick to pledge funds, but
getting all the exact written agreements in place took time. This points to the need for
donors to be flexible regarding formal agreements, and accept simple, generic
paragraphs that can contribute to speedy resolution of slightly differing phrasings and
concerns. Second, the processing time for project approval and implementation was a
concern. Since the MDF was to have funded projects on-budget, they had to be
implemented by government institutions. This crated bottlenecks.
6. Smaller donors joined because they wished to support the reconstruction efforts in
Aceh but do not have own capacity and often not strong views on how best to pursue
this. They want the Bank to assume fiduciary responsibilities for the funds in a high-risk
environment, and also to take a lead in ensuring that the funds go to prioritized
activities. The MDF is thus seen a well-managed bank account with some paid-for
administrative services. However, the all-inclusive Steering Committee made
membership large and to some extent unwieldy, and forced it to discuss both policy and
operational issues.
7. The Multi Donor Fund Secretariat has developed an Outreach Strategy that includes
regular radio talk shows, field visits to meet and discuss with beneficiaries and
communication through advertisements as well as a telephone hotline.
8. MDF received praise for engaging the Government of Indonesia (G01) in policy dialogue.
The MDF is thus an entry point for engaging on conditions for sustainability, relevance
and impact.
9. Because the MDF does not accept strict ear marking of donor contributions — though it
does allow for preference indications — it means that the funds are freely available for
programming according to the criteria and priorities that the MDF agrees to. Given
strong GOI participation, the MDF is seen as the most successful instrument for
harmonization and coordination in an environment that has been criticized for a lack of
coordination. The MDF's Mid Term Review conducted in 2008-2009 found that the MDF
had made a positive contribution to harmonizing donor efforts and to increasing the
effectiveness and efficiency of the reconstruction effort.
10. The MDF did not sufficiently engage the private sector and did not have a coherent job
creation strategy. The MDF lacked executive rights, but GOI and BRR are credited with
leveraging a decisive response.

Can you call Froman and discuss the cotton issue since I told the press--in response to a question--that I knew there
would be retaliatory actions announced next week and that a high level delegation would come from DC to make a
countervailing proposal w the hope of avoiding the imposition of the retaliation 30 days after they're announced. So
what are the odds of that working? Not high, I believe so this combined w refusal on Iran sanctions will lead to difficult
reactions from Congress toward Brazil. Then we have management problem on our hands.
