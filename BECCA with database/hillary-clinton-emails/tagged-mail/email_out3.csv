Subject: Freedom of Expression - UN Human Rights
Jake,
I wanted to update you on two aspects of our work leading up to the September session at the UN Human
Rights Council where the U.S. will be a full member for the first time: 1) freedom of expression (addressed in
this email) and 2) human rights strategy at the UN (in a second email on high side).
First, I'd like to let you know about the successful next step in a strategy we are pursuing at the UN Human
Rights Council to begin to change the dialogue on Freedom of Expression. We think we have developed a
well-balanced text that we can move forward to adoption in the UN HRC's September session. This work
contributes to our long-term effort to improve this UN body. Progress on this issue would help us later as we
address the even more difficult issue of the ""defamation of religions"" about which the Secretary expressed
interest in a Monday senior staff meeting.
An 10-DRL-L-NEA group has been working together to implement the strategy that involves reaching
agreement with the Egyptians on a text that we will roll out late next week with countries in the OIC
(Organization of the Islamic Conference) and the WEOG (Western European and Other Group, our regional
group at the UN).
Experts in L, DRL, 10, and NEA agree that the text protects all USG red lines and offers us a workable
compromise that can secure genuine cross-regional consensus when presented in the Human Rights Council in
September, hopefully avoiding a divisive vote on this issue. US and Egyptian teams also agreed to the
possibility of further cooperation in the UNGA to come to a soft landing on defamation of religions if Cairo and
Washington first succeed in passing the FoE resolution by OIC/WEOG consensus.

Obama administration picks former Gates Foundation official to run US foreign aid
By MATTHEW LEE
Associated Press

11 SINGAPORE (AP) _ The Obama administration will nominate a young former executive with the Bill and
Melinda Gates Foundation to run America's top foreign assistance program, ending months of speculation
and complaints about who would take the vacant post, U.S. officials said Tuesday.
$ President Barack Obama has chosen Rajiv Shah, a medical doctor and currently a senior official at the
Department of Agriculture dealing with food security, to run the U.S. Agency for International
Development, the officials said.
¶ The officials spoke on condition of anonymity pending notification to Congress and a formal public
announcement of the choice.
11 Shah's selection, which must still be confirmed by the Senate, would end a 10-month leadership
vacuum at USAID, which has been operating with an acting director since Obama took office despite his
campaign pledges to have the agency play a greater role in foreign policy.
11 Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton have said USAID is crucial to deploying their
preferred ""smart power"" foreign policy strategy, which envisions more equal roles for diplomacy and
development alongside defense. They plan to double the amount of foreign aid.
11 The agency will play a key role in the administration's efforts in Afghanistan and Pakistan, where
officials believe the civilian component must be strengthened.
$ But the top job at the agency has remained vacant until now, with several prime candidates'
withdrawing from consideration amid a White House vetting process that Clinton denounced in July as
""ridiculous,"" ""a nightmare,"" and ""frustrating beyond words.""
$ Shah, 36, whose family immigrated to the U.S. from India, is now the Under Secretary for Research,
Education and Economics and Chief Scientist at the Agriculture Department where he manages a budget
of more than $2.6 billion and more than 10,000 staff around the world.
¶ Before that, he had several positions at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, including managing its
$1.5 billion contribution to a global vaccination fund and helping launch the foundation's Global
Development program where he oversaw a $1.3 billion investment portfolio.
The lingering USAID vacancy, particularly after several leading candidates pulled out, had upset
development experts and Congress. Some lawmakers had suggested that Obama choose someone who
had already gone through the vetting process.
¶ Shah fits that bill and has important political credentials, having worked with or for several leading
Democratic politicians.

HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
October 15, 2009
Congressional Record
H11434
Volume 155, Issue 149
111th Congress - First Session
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under a previous order of the House, the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen) is
recognized for 5 minutes.
Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my longstanding commitment to assist the Haitian people in
their pursuit of a stable, prosperous and democratic future.
During my trip to Haiti, I was reminded of the tremendous challenges facing this island nation. The U.N.'s appointment
of President Clinton as special envoy to Haiti has helped to keep a much-needed spotlight on Haiti. President Clinton's
appointment of Dr. Paul Farmer as the Deputy U.N. Special Envoy for Haiti, adds an invaluable wealth of experience and
knowledge to the U.N.'s work in Haiti.
As a founder of Partners in Health and the Institute for Justice & Democracy in Haiti, Dr. Farmer has demonstrated a
selfless commitment to the advancement of health and democracy in Haiti for the past 20 years. I have witnessed
firsthand Dr. Farmer's dedication to helping improve the lives of those in need.
He has strong south Florida ties. I am proud to call him a friend, along with our mutual friend, Jennie Block, who has also
worked so hard on issues of concern to the Haitian community.
I understand that the conference on the Inter-American Development Bank in Haiti went quite well. I was pleased to see
that the United Nations voted unanimously this week to extend the authorization for the U.N. Mission in Haiti for
another year.
I would also like to take a moment to express my condolences to the families of those who lost their lives in last
weekend's plane crash during a U.N. mission. The U.N. mission in Haiti has helped to play an important role in bringing
security and stability to some of the most dangerous neighborhoods in Haiti. I continue to support its mission and the
many men and women from around the world who work to carry it out.

However, it seems that Haiti just can't get to the next step. From assistance to debt relief, from trade benefits to
hurricane recovery, U.S. policy toward Haiti has run the gamut, but it is not achieving the long-term goals that we had
hoped for for the Haitian people and that the Haitian people want for themselves and their nation.
I am pleased to know that our State Department is taking'a closerlook at some of the challenges we are facing in Haiti.
Last week, Secretary Clinton's chief of staff and her point person on Haiti briefed Members on some of the initial
findings of this review.
I am confident that this review will help us to better understand how U.S. assistance to Haiti can be better targeted and
supportive of Haiti's own plans and goals; how assistance within the donor community can be better coordinated; how
the U.S. can better engage the Haitian Diaspora in our assistance efforts; and, finally, how the U.S. can finally make our
assistance sustainable so that outside efforts can ultimately be transferred into the hands of the Haitian government
and its people.
It is crucial that the efforts made by the U.S., the U.N. and others are effectively coordinated to ensure maximum
efficiency and maximum benefit for the people of Haiti. Innovative microcredit and microenterprise programs would
help to empower individuals, create self-reliance and create sustainability at the grassroots level. We should also look at
the very small-scale renewable energy programs for impoverished rural villages and settlements that are not served by
electric grids.
One of the immediate ways we can help the people of Haiti would be to grant temporary protected status to the
Haitians currently living in the U.S. Granting TPS to Haitians is the missing piece of a successful U.S. approach to
supporting the people of Haiti in the short and long term. I will continue to work with my colleagues to encourage the
administration to take this important step.
In addition, I will continue to support Haiti's inclusion in security initiatives, such as the Merida Initiative, to ensure that
the U.S. is doing all we can to help President Preval in his efforts against the narcotraffickers.
Success in Haiti is in the U.S. national security interest, and we must work together to help address the many challenges
we face and that our Caribbean neighbor faces day in and day out.

The parties have reached agreement tonight. Shaun will call you on Sunday to brief. Gordon will fly into Belfast on

Subject: FYI - Raj Shah Background
Rajiv Shah
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Current Under Secretary Rajiv Shah
Rajiv ""Raj"" Shah (born March 9, 1973) is presently Under Secretary of Agriculture for Research, Education,
and Economics (REE) and Chief Scientist at the United States Department of Agriculture.
Prior to his appointment at USDA, Shah worked in a range of leadership roles at the Bill & Melinda Gates
Foundation including Director of Agricultural Development, Director of Financial Services, leader of the
Strategic Opportunities initiative and manager of the Foundation's $1.5 billion commitment to the Vaccine
Fund. He also came up with the idea for the International Finance Facility for Immunization to transform the
global system of vaccine financing, and worked to secure donor commitments of more than $5 billion for this
facility. Before joining the Gates Foundation, Shah was a health care policy advisor on the Al Gore presidential
campaign, 2000 and a member of Governor Ed Rendell's (D-PA) transition committee on health.
Shah earned his M.D. from the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine and M.Sc. in Health Economics
at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. He is a graduate of the University of Michigan and
also attended the London School of Economics.
President Obama announced Shah's selection as Under Secretary of Research, Education, and Economics and
Chief Scientist on April 17, 2009. Shah's nomination was confirmed by the United States Senate by unanimous
consent on May 12, 2009.
Early life and family
Born to Indian immigrant parents who settled in Ann Arbor, Michigan in the late 60's, Raj Shah grew up in the
Detroit area and attended Wylie Groves High School.
He lives with his wife, Shivam, and their two young children, Sajan and Amna. He has one sister, Ami Shah,
who is a medical doctor.

Career
Raj Shah is currently the Under Secretary of Research, Education and Economics (REE) and Chief Scientist at
the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The REE mission area provides the science that federal agencies, policy
makers, researchers, and others draw on to meet challenges facing America's food and agriculture system. The
four REE agencies are the Agricultural Research Service (including the National Agricultural Library), the
Economic Research Service, the National Agricultural Statistics Service, and the Cooperative State Research,
Education and Extension Service.
Prior to his appointment at USDA Raj worked in a range of leadership roles at the Bill & Melinda Gates
Foundation to help the poorest people on earth lead healthy and productive lives.
As the Director of the Agricultural Development program, Shah oversaw the foundation's multi-billion dollar
portfolio of grant and program-related investments to help transform rural economies throughout the developing
world and help small farmers and their families overcome hunger and poverty. He led efforts to create the
Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa, helped recruit its leadership including UN Secretary General Kofi
Annan, and serves on its Board of Directors. He oversaw grant portfolios in science and technology; farmer
productivity; market access; and policy, statistics and advocacy; and managed a team of more than 60
professionals. He also developed innovative partnerships with private industry, the United Nations, the World
Bank, and country governments around the world, where he was an active voice on issues related to food and
hunger.
As the Foundation's first Director for the Financial Services to the Poor portfolio, Shah worked with a broad
range of financial institutions and other donors to determine how Foundation resources could best amplify the
field's collective impact. Previously, he led the Strategic Opportunities initiative which worked with Foundation
co-chairs to identify, assess and recommend new areas of giving. This process led to the creation of the
Foundation's Global Development Program.
Shah's early work with the Foundation focused on global health. As Deputy Director for Policy and Finance,
Raj managed the Foundation's $1.5 billion commitment to the Vaccine Fund — an effort referred to by Bill and
Melinda Gates as their best investment. He also came up with the idea for the International Finance Facility for
Immunization to transform the global system of vaccine financing and worked to secure donor commitments of
more than $5 billion for this facility. The World Health Organization estimates this initiative will save more
than five million children's lives through the next decade, and a New York Times article described the effort as
""a clever way to reduce the burden of costly diseases now and save money in the future.""
Shah previously worked as a health care policy advisor on the Gore 2000 presidential campaign, was an active
supporter of the Barack Obama presidential campaign, 2008, and served as a member of Pennsylvania Governor
Ed Rendell's health transition committee. He also co-founded Health Systems Analytics (a health care
consulting firm), served as an advisor to the City of Philadelphia's Public Health Commissioner, and worked at
the World Health Organization. In addition, he co-founded multiple nonprofit organizations focused on
increasing the political awareness and civic engagement of minority communities, including Project Impact for
South Asian Americans.

How do I know China wrecked the Copenhagen
deal? I was in the room
As recriminations fly post-Copenhagen, one writer offers a fly-on-the-wall account of how talks faded
0
0 Mark cvnas
o c.
..q,uk, Tuesday 22 December 2009 19.54 GMT
Copenhagen was a disaster. That much is agreed. But the truth about what actually happened is in danger of being lost
amid the spin and inevitable mutual recriminations. The truth is this: Chrs.a wrecked the talks, intentionally humiliated
Barack Obama, and insisted on an awful ""dear so western leaders would walk away carrying the blame. How do I know
this? Because I was in the room and saw it happen.
China's strategy was simple: block the open negotiations for two weeks, and then ensure that the closed-door deal made
It look as if the west had failed the world's poor once again. And sure enough, the aid agencies, civil society movements
and environmental groups all took the bait. The failure was ""the inevitable result of rich countries refusing adequately and
fairly to shoulder their overwhelming responsibility"", said Christian Aid. ""Rich countries have bullied developing nations,""
fumed Friends of the Earth International.
All very predictable, but the complete opposite of the truth. Even George IVIonbiot, writing in yesterday's Guardian, made
the mistake of singly blaming Obama. But I saw Obama fighting desperately to salvage a deal, and the Chinese delegate
saying ""no"", over and over again. Monbiot even approvingly quoted the Sudanese delegate Lumumba Di-Aping, who
denounced the Copenhagen accord as ""a suicide pact, an incineration pact, in order to maintain the economic dominance
of a few countries"".
Sudan behaves at the talks as a puppet of China; one of a number of countries that relieves the Chinese delegation of
having to fight its battles in open sessions. It was a perfect stitch-up. China gutted the deal behind the scenes, and then
left its proxies to savage it in public.
Here's what actually went on late last Friday night, as heads of state from two dozen countries met behind closed doors.
Obama was at the table for several hours, sitting between Gordon Brown and the Ethiopian prime minister, Males Zenawi.
The Danish prime minister chaired, and on his right sat Ban Ki-moon, secretary-general of the UN. Probably only about 50
or 60 people, including the heads of state, were in the room. I was attached to one of the delegations, whose head of
state was also present for most of the time.
What I saw was profoundly shocking. The Chinese premier, Wen Jinbao, did not deign to attend the meetings personally,
instead sending a second-tier official in the country's foreign ministry to sit opposite Obama himself. The diplomatic snub
was obvious and brutal, as was the practical implication: several times during the session, the world's most powerful
heads of state were forced to wait around as the Chinese delegate went off to make telephone calls to his ""superiors"".
Shifting the blame
To those who would blame Obama and rich countries in general, know this: it was China's representative who insisted
that industrialised country targets, previously agreed as an 80% cut by 2050, be taken out of the deal. ""Why can't we even
mention our own targets?"" demanded a furious Angela Merkel. Australia's prime minister, Kevin Rudd, was annoyed
enough to bang his microphone. Brazil's representative too pointed out the illogicality of China's position. Why should rich
countries not announce even this unilateral cut? The Chinese delegate said no, and I watched, aghast, as Merkel threw
up her hands in despair and conceded the point. Now we know why — because China bet, correctly, that Obama would
get the blame for the Copenhagen accord's lack of ambition.
China, backed at times by India, then proceeded to take out all the numbers that mattered. A 2020 peaking year in global
emissions, essential to restrain temperatures to 2C, was removed and replaced by woolly language suggesting that
emissions should peak ""as soon as possible"". The long-term target, of global 50% cuts by 2050, was also excised. No one
else, perhaps with the exceptions of India and Saudi Arabia, wanted this to happen. I am certain that had the Chinese not
been in the room, we would have left Copenhagen with a deal that had environmentalists popping champagne corks
popping in every corner of the world.
Strong position
So how did China manage to pull off this coup? First, it was in an extremely strong negotiating position. China didn't need
a deal. As one developing country foreign minister said to me: ""The Athenians had nothing to offer to the Spartans."" On
the other hand, western leaders in particular — but also presidents Lula of Brazil, Zuma of South Africa, Calderon of
Mexico and many others — were desperate for a positive outcome. Obama needed a strong deal perhaps more than
anyone. The US had confirmed the offer of $100bn to developing countries for adaptation, put serious cuts on the table for
the first time (17% below 2005 levels by 2020), and was obviously prepared to up its offer.
Above all, Obama needed to be able to demonstrate to the Senate that he could deliver China in any global climate
regulation framework, so conservative senators could not argue that US carbon cuts would further advantage Chinese
industry. With midterm elections looming, Obama and his staff also knew that Copenhagen would be probably their only
opportunity to go to cjinT3t?j..chanQE-3. talks with a strong mandate. This further strengthened China's negotiating hand, as
did the complete lack of civil society political pressure on either China or India. Campaign groups never blame developing
countries for failure; this is an iron rule that is never broken. The Indians, in particular. have become past masters at ca-
opting the language of equity (""equal rights to the atmosphere"") in the service of planetary suicide — and leftish
campaigners and commentators are hoist with their own petard.
With the deal gutted, the heads of state session concluded with a final battle as the Chinese delegate insisted on
removing the 1.5C target so beloved of the small island states and low-lying nations who have most to lose from rising
seas. President Nasheed of the Maldives, supported by Brown, fought valiantly to save this crucial number. ""How can you
ask my country to go extinct?"" demanded Nasheed. The Chinese delegate feigned great offence — and the number
stayed, but surrounded by language which makes it all but meaningless. The deed was done.
China's game
All this raises the question: what is China's game? Why did China, in the words of a UK-based analyst who also spent
hours in heads of state meetings, ""not only reject targets for itself, but also refuse to allow any other country to take on
binding targets?"" The analyst, who has attended climate conferences for more than 15 years, concludes that China wants
to weaken the climate regulation regime now ""in order to avoid the risk that it might be called on to be more ambitious in a
few years' time"".
This does not mean China is not serious about global warming. It is strong in both the wind and solar industries. But
China's growth, and growing global political and economic dominance, is based largely on cheap coal. China knows it is
becoming an uncontested superpower; indeed its newfound muscular confidence was on striking display in Copenhagen.
Its coal-based economy doubles every decade, and its power increases commensurately. Its leadership will not alter this
magic formula unless they absolutely have to.
Copenhagen was much worse than just another bad deal, because it illustrated a profound shift in global geopolitics. This
is fast becoming China's century, yet its leadership has displayed that multilateral environmental governance is not only
not a priority, but is viewed as a hindrance to the new superpower's freedom of action. I left Copenhagen more
despondent than I have felt in a long time. After all the hope and all the hype, the mobilisation of thousands, a wave of
optimism crashed against the rock of global power politics, fell back, and drained away.

How do I know China wrecked the Copenhagen

As recriminations fly post-Copenhagen, one writer offers a fly-on-the-wall account of how talks faded

..q,uk, Tuesday 22 December 2009 19.54 GMT
Copenhagen was a disaster. That much is agreed. But the truth about what actually happened is in danger of being lost
amid the spin and inevitable mutual recriminations. The truth is this: Chrs.a wrecked the talks, intentionally humiliated
Barack Obama, and insisted on an awful ""dear so western leaders would walk away carrying the blame. How do I know
this? Because I was in the room and saw it happen.
China's strategy was simple: block the open negotiations for two weeks, and then ensure that the closed-door deal made
It look as if the west had failed the world's poor once again. And sure enough, the aid agencies, civil society movements
and environmental groups all took the bait. The failure was ""the inevitable result of rich countries refusing adequately and
fairly to shoulder their overwhelming responsibility"", said Christian Aid. ""Rich countries have bullied developing nations,""
fumed Friends of the Earth International.
All very predictable, but the complete opposite of the truth. Even George IVIonbiot, writing in yesterday's Guardian, made
the mistake of singly blaming Obama. But I saw Obama fighting desperately to salvage a deal, and the Chinese delegate
saying ""no"", over and over again. Monbiot even approvingly quoted the Sudanese delegate Lumumba Di-Aping, who
denounced the Copenhagen accord as ""a suicide pact, an incineration pact, in order to maintain the economic dominance
of a few countries"".
Sudan behaves at the talks as a puppet of China; one of a number of countries that relieves the Chinese delegation of
having to fight its battles in open sessions. It was a perfect stitch-up. China gutted the deal behind the scenes, and then
left its proxies to savage it in public.
Here's what actually went on late last Friday night, as heads of state from two dozen countries met behind closed doors.
Obama was at the table for several hours, sitting between Gordon Brown and the Ethiopian prime minister, Males Zenawi.
The Danish prime minister chaired, and on his right sat Ban Ki-moon, secretary-general of the UN. Probably only about 50
or 60 people, including the heads of state, were in the room. I was attached to one of the delegations, whose head of
state was also present for most of the time.
What I saw was profoundly shocking. The Chinese premier, Wen Jinbao, did not deign to attend the meetings personally,
instead sending a second-tier official in the country's foreign ministry to sit opposite Obama himself. The diplomatic snub
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05766567 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05766567 Date: 08/31/2015
was obvious and brutal, as was the practical implication: several times during the session, the world's most powerful
heads of state were forced to wait around as the Chinese delegate went off to make telephone calls to his ""superiors"".
Shifting the blame
To those who would blame Obama and rich countries in general, know this: it was China's representative who insisted
that industrialised country targets, previously agreed as an 80% cut by 2050, be taken out of the deal. ""Why can't we even
mention our own targets?"" demanded a furious Angela Merkel. Australia's prime minister, Kevin Rudd, was annoyed
enough to bang his microphone. Brazil's representative too pointed out the illogicality of China's position. Why should rich
countries not announce even this unilateral cut? The Chinese delegate said no, and I watched, aghast, as Merkel threw
up her hands in despair and conceded the point. Now we know why — because China bet, correctly, that Obama would
get the blame for the Copenhagen accord's lack of ambition.
China, backed at times by India, then proceeded to take out all the numbers that mattered. A 2020 peaking year in global
emissions, essential to restrain temperatures to 2C, was removed and replaced by woolly language suggesting that
emissions should peak ""as soon as possible"". The long-term target, of global 50% cuts by 2050, was also excised. No one
else, perhaps with the exceptions of India and Saudi Arabia, wanted this to happen. I am certain that had the Chinese not
been in the room, we would have left Copenhagen with a deal that had environmentalists popping champagne corks
popping in every corner of the world.
Strong position
So how did China manage to pull off this coup? First, it was in an extremely strong negotiating position. China didn't need

In the past 48 hours, the political situation in Pakistan has entered a new phase. The Supreme Court ruled the NRO
illegal and paved the way for prosecution of several government officials, most notably Interior Minister Rehman Malik.
Malik has been summoned before the Court and the Defense Minister (along with 247 other officials) was barred from
traveling to China on an official visit. Vali Nasr has been following the fast-moving and still unclear developments
closely.
In addition, the Supreme Court has opened the door to new petitions to be filed, questioning
Zardari's eligibility to have run for president in the first place. The Court could use those petitions to force Zardari from
office in the near future. It is clear that Zardari's fate will be decided by the military, which has been gaining prominence
and will be in an even stronger position after this shake-up.
In the past two days Gilani has come to Zardari's defense, suggesting the two have reached an agreement over
transfer of power from president to prime minister.

RE: NY Local Issues
Schools - NYC public schools open on Wednesday, September 9th. As a result, you will be visiting a charter school that
opened a couple of weeks ago instead of a public school. Mike Mulgrew, who took over as President of the UFT when
Randi left for AFT, will be present at the event and should be acknowledged in your remarks. His aides who you have
met numerous times, Dick Riley and Bridget Rein, will also be present. Mike appointed Dick as his press secretary last
month.
H1N1 - Mayor Bloomberg did a rollout earlier this week on NYC's plans to handle this health concern, and a significant
portion discusses schools. Unlike what was done in the Spring, this time closing schools will be a last resort. Reason is
that they found kids still contaminate each other by going to movies and playgrounds when the schools are closed, so
instead they are asking sick kids to stay home.
And if four percent of a student body experiences the flu on a single day, a doctor will visit to monitor the situation.
Every student in a NYC school will be offered free H1N1 flu shots or mist once a vaccine is available.
Primary day - September 15th is primary day. In addition to Bill Thompson for Mayor, the primary races that have been
closely followed are Public Advocate and City Comptroller. Running for Public Advocate are Councilmember Eric Gioia,
Councilmember Bill DeBlasio, former Public Advocate Mark Green, and civil rights lawyer Norman Siegel. Running for
Comptroller are four Councilmembers: John Lui, Melinda Katz, David Yassky, and David Weprin.
Rangel - As of last week House Speaker Pelosi plans to allow Rep. Rangel to keep his chairmanship of the Ways and
Means Committee despite his ethics problems. According to amended forms recently filed with the House, Rangel failed
to disclose at least $800,000 in assets and income since 2002. This comes amid a House ethics investigation into his
failure to report income from and pay taxes on a villa in the Dominican Republic and his ties to a real-estate developer
who leased him four rent-stabilized apartments in New York. The panel is also looking into Rangel's fundraising and
whether he improperly used his office to raise money for a public policy center in his name at the City University of New
York. Rangel has denied any wrongdoing and says its accounting mistakes and simple oversights. The NY Post and
Buffalo News have called for his resignation. Speaking at a health-care forum in Washington Heights last Tuesday, Rangel
said that bias and prejudice toward Obama are fueling opposition to health-care reform. ""Some Americans have not
gotten over the fact that Obama is president of the United States. They go to sleep wondering, 'How did this happen?' ""
Rangel said. Rangel then likened the battle over health-care expansion for the uninsured to the fight for civil rights.
""Why do we have to wait for the right to vote? Why can't we get what God has given us? That is the right to live as
human beings and not negotiate with white southerners and not count the votes. Just do the right thing,"" he said. After
the forum, Rangel insisted he was not smearing opponents as racists. ""What I'm saying is, if you watch the town-hall
meetings, people were angry and did not care what the answer was to some of their questions. They were angry with
their member of Congress, period,"" he said. Rangel's comments came less than two weeks after Governor Paterson
claimed he has been the victim of a racist white media -- and also suggested that opposition to Obama's plan is racially
driven. The White House disagreed with Paterson's comments.

DOJ has finally award his brother the 9/11 Heroes Medal of Valor. You were very supportive of Jay's efforts and wrote
letters to DOJ. Glenn worked at a law firm near the WTC, but was also a volunteer FF. After helping to evacuate his
building he went to the WTC area to help and unfortunately died when the South Tower fell. Senator Schumer and Rep
Pete King held a press conference on Tuesday making the announcement at a park named in Glenn's honor in their

closely followed are Public Advocate and City Comptroller. Running for Public Advocate are Councilmember Eric Gioia,
Councilmember Bill DeBlasio, former Public Advocate Mark Green, and civil rights lawyer Norman Siegel. Running for
Comptroller are four Councilmembers: John Lui, Melinda Katz, David Yassky, and David Weprin.
Rangel - As of last week House Speaker Pelosi plans to allow Rep. Rangel to keep his chairmanship of the Ways and
Means Committee despite his ethics problems. According to amended forms recently filed with the House, Rangel failed
to disclose at least $800,000 in assets and income since 2002. This comes amid a House ethics investigation into his
failure to report income from and pay taxes on a villa in the Dominican Republic and his ties to a real-estate developer
who leased him four rent-stabilized apartments in New York. The panel is also looking into Rangel's fundraising and
whether he improperly used his office to raise money for a public policy center in his name at the City University of New
York. Rangel has denied any wrongdoing and says its accounting mistakes and simple oversights. The NY Post and
Buffalo News have called for his resignation. Speaking at a health-care forum in Washington Heights last Tuesday, Rangel
said that bias and prejudice toward Obama are fueling opposition to health-care reform. ""Some Americans have not
gotten over the fact that Obama is president of the United States. They go to sleep wondering, 'How did this happen?' ""
Rangel said. Rangel then likened the battle over health-care expansion for the uninsured to the fight for civil rights.
""Why do we have to wait for the right to vote? Why can't we get what God has given us? That is the right to live as
human beings and not negotiate with white southerners and not count the votes. Just do the right thing,"" he said. After
the forum, Rangel insisted he was not smearing opponents as racists. ""What I'm saying is, if you watch the town-hall
meetings, people were angry and did not care what the answer was to some of their questions. They were angry with
their member of Congress, period,"" he said. Rangel's comments came less than two weeks after Governor Paterson
claimed he has been the victim of a racist white media -- and also suggested that opposition to Obama's plan is racially
driven. The White House disagreed with Paterson's comments.

Subject: (Reuters) China says Britain sowing discord in climate politics
BEIJING - China condemned claims ascribed to Britain's climate change minister that it had ""hijacked"" negotiations in
Copenhagen, saying on Tuesday the accusations were an attempt to sow discord among poor countries.
The sharp words from Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Jiang Yu were the latest baring of diplomatic bad blood
after the talks in Copenhagen ended on Saturday with a broad, non-binding accord that fell short of hopes for a robust
global agreement on how to curb greenhouse gas emissions.
Jiang was responding to a report in Britain's Guardian newspaper that said the Environment Minister Ed Miliband had
accused China, Sudan, Bolivia and other left-wing Latin American nations of ""hijacking"" efforts to reach deeper
agreement on how to fight global warming.
In a separate commentary for the paper, Miliband said China vetoed a widely supported proposal at the Copenhagen
talks to aim to cut global greenhouse gas emissions by 50 percent by 2050.
""We cannot again allow negotiations on real points of substance to be hijacked,"" he also wrote, but without singling out
China or any other country as a ""hijacker.""
Chinese spokeswoman Jiang did not chide Miliband by name, but Beijing's ire was clear.
""The statements from certain British politicians are plainly a political scheme,"" she said in a statement issued by the
official Xinhua news agency.
""Their objective is to shirk responsibilities that should be assumed towards developing countries, and to provoke discord
among developing countries. This scheme will come to nothing.""
The flap is unlikely to seriously disrupt negotiations seeking to turn the Copenhagen accord into a legally binding treaty.
But the sour exchange has underscored the distrust between China and rich countries that could frustrate efforts to
agree on that treaty by late 2010.
""Everyone is raising the banner of protecting the planet, but in reality they are protecting their own interests,"" Wang Vi,
a climate change policy researcher at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, told Reuters.
""The compromises (in Copenhagen) were very, very limited.""
China is the world's biggest emitter of greenhouse gases from human activities and its biggest developing economy.
Other governments have pressed it to do more to reduce its growing emissions and to submit its emissions goals to
international checks as part of any new climate pact.
But China and other big developing countries have accused the rich economies of failing to offer big enough cuts to their
emissions, and of not offering enough money and technological help to poor countries to cope with climate change.
Chinese experts have also said the goal of cutting global greenhouse gas emissions by 50 percent by 2050 is empty
rhetoric without those commitments from rich nations.
""Currently, the most difficult issue to resolve is the scale and structure of each country's emissions reductions,"" said Li
Zhiqing, an environmental policy professor at Fudan University in Shanghai, writing in the city's Wenhui Daily
newspaper.
""Clearly, there will be no breakthrough on this in the near term and we can only maintain the status quo,"" wrote Li.

RELEASE IN PART B5
The Secretary's Call Sheet for
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon
August 24, 2009
Purpose of Call: You are calling UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to ask him
to co-host with you an event at UNGA to advance the Global Partnership for
Agriculture and Food Security.
• UNGA Food Security Event: I would like to co-host with you an event to
advance the global agenda on food security. We see country-led processes as a
centerpiece of a new global agenda. This event would most likely take place on
Thursday, September 24, at 3:30pm. If you cannot co-host the meeting, I would
welcome the participation of your representative at the meeting.
• Event Content: We would like this event to be an opportunity for a broad
group of global stakeholders to commit to the food security principles agreed to
at the L'Aquila summit. We hope to extend the L'Aquila food security
principles to countries that were not present at the summit. The event will also
focus on highlighting country-led processes, such as the Comprehensive
African Agricultural Development Program (CAADP). I welcome your
thoughts on other issues you would like the meeting to cover. We look to the
UN to provide leadership in advancing a global agenda.
• Event Partners: We envision inviting Heads of State or senior ministers from
donor countries, signatories to the L'Aquila joint statement on food security,
and developing nations. We would also like to include foundations, NGOs, the
private sector, media, and multilateral organizations.
Background: We want Ban Ki-moon and the UN High Level Task Force to play
a leading role in combating global hunger. We believe that co-hosting this event
with UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon would highlight the global nature of our
food security strategy.

Hil Hope you all are getting some R&R as the summer wanes.
Your Africa trip has generated a lot of visibility and momentum on women's issues. I wanted to follow up on an idea we
discussed, when we met a few months ago, for raising the profile of women's issues and creating a unique platform for
you in the U.S.
You may recall that Melanne and I were developing ideas for holding events to connect people working on women's
issues around the world, and to raise the visibility of the issues in the US.
Whitney Williams has joined us to flesh out a vision for a series of conferences that would bring together policymakers
and experts from the field with women you have met around the world - and people at the grassroots level in this
country.
Each conference would be followed by a special event featuring musical, cultural and culinary celebrities (yep, celebrity
chefs) from the U.S. and other countries to generate visibility online and in the entertainment media, which would reach
a lot more people than the policy conference alone.
These events would create connections among people who often work in isolation, and generate ideas for improving
policies and practices. They'd also inspire and engage a whole new generation to get involved in global women's issues.
This approach — bringing together policy, grassroots and entertainment aspects — isn't being done by anyone else in the
development space. It would be a great way to raise the visibility of the issues, and your work on them, here at home.
We could put on several over the next year, with one on the 15th Anniversary of your UN speech in Beijing.

everyone is in town for Capricia's swearing-in.) Would you like to do that?

Subject: Possible Rieser Call on Foreign Ops Bill
Cheryl:
We have just learned that Tim Rieser may call you soon to request that the Secretary call Senator Reid to urge
him take up the FY10 State/Foreign Ops Appropriations Bill at the earliest opportunity in September —to avoid
the negative impact of a continuing resolution on State operations and programs.
As you know, if Senator Reid was able/willing to schedule time on the Senate floor there still remains a
significant obstacle. While the FY10 Bill had broad bipartisan support prior to markup, it now includes a
controversial Lautenberg amendment that would reverse the Mexico City policy statutorily. With
Lautenberg's amendment in the Bill, procedural hurdles are almost certain to lengthen and slow down floor
action.
It is possible that an agreement could be reached to bring up the Bill and structure votes so that the
Republicans could offer amendments including one to strike Lautenberg's language.
Should you agree to ask the Secretary to make such a call I would imagine she would want to get views from
Jack Lew, Pat Kennedy, Rich Greene, and Rich Verma, first.
Here are some points to consider for such a possible call:
• Timely enactment of the FY 10 State/Foreign Ops appropriation is critical to national security.
• Operating under a Continuing Resolution for any extended period of time will negatively impact
both State operations and foreign assistance programs.
• For example, the funds available to support State operations in Iraq are estimated to last only
through the first quarter of FY 2010. In addition our urgent hiring plans will be stifled, pay equity
authorities will lapse, and we will be without the necessary resources to implement our agenda on food
security, climate change, and global health.
• I urge you to take up the FY 10 State/Foreign Ops bill as early as possible in September.

Mexico City Policy: The inclusion during markup of the Lautenberg amendment in the Senate bill codifies a
ban on future adoption of the Mexico City Policy. This controversial issue will slow down consideration of
the Bill, as the Minority will use parliamentary maneuvers to block timely debate and final passage.

RELIEF SUPPLIES TO BE AIRLIFTED FROM GREATER LOS
ANGELES AREA TO SAMOA IN RESPONSE TO
DEVASTATING TSUNAMI
Chairman of the Subcommittee on Asia, the Pacific and the Global Environment,
Congressman Eni F.H. Faleomavaega, and Congresswoman Laura Richardson (D-CA),
announced today that the U.S. Department of State called them this morning to inform them that
Secretary Clinton has authorized the use of funds from the Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance
(OFDA) to get emergency relief supplies airlifted from the greater Los Angeles area to Samoa in
response to the devastating tsunami that struck Apia on September 29.
In his capacity as Chairman of the Asia Pacific Subcommittee which has broad
jurisdiction for U.S. foreign policy affecting the region, including Samoa, Chairman
Faleomavaega personally spoke to Secretary Clinton on Oct 1 and, in letters dated Oct 4 and Oct
5, followed up with her regarding the specific need to airlift emergency supplies to Apia, which
were gathered by the Samoan communities and congregations in the greater Los Angeles area.

The Samoan communities in the greater Los Angeles directly contacted Faleomavaega
for assistance because many of their families and relatives live in his district of American Samoa
or Samoa. Congresswoman Laura Richardson has worked closely with Faleomavaega
throughout this process given that she represents part of the greater Los Angeles area, and the
Samoan communities living in that area are her constituents,
""I want to personally thank Secretary Clinton for her untiring efforts in getting these
relief supplies airlifted,"" Chairman Faleomavaega said. ""Since the tsunami struck, Secretary
Clinton has spared no effort in coming to our aid, and even called upon the U.S. Department of
Defense (DOD) to quickly move these supplies from the West Coast to Samoa. Last evening,
Congresswoman Richardson and I learned that DOD had agreed to move the supplies but that
due to legalities of moving privately-donated goods, the process would take too long.""
""In a previous conference call yesterday, anticipating that DOD might be unable to
quickly move these supplies, we requested the State Department to fund a commercial flight
through the Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance should we encounter any problems with
DOD,"" Faleomavaega and Rep. Richardson said. ""Last night, upon learning that the DOD
process would take too long and in consideration of our request for a more immediate airlift,
Secretary Clinton assessed the options while en route to Europe, and this morning the State
Department informed us that Secretary Clinton has agreed to fund the flight with OFDA funds.""
""The agreement is that this will be a one-time airlift, and our Samoan communities
should make future donations in cash, rather than in commodities. We will not be able to airlift
frozen goods, and our offices will work closely with the communities to gather the supplies to a
central location for the airlift. Also, the airlift provided by the U.S. Department of State can only
be authorized to land in Samoa. While we were also hopeful to get supplies in to American
Samoa, all matters relating to American Samoa are decided between the Governor and FEMA,
according to federal law.""
""I know from my meeting earlier this week with Prime Minister Tuilaepa Sailele
Malielegaoi that he is thankful to the Samoan congregations and communities in the greater Los
Angeles area who responded from the heart by collecting critical supplies that will now be
airlifted to those in need,"" Faleomavaega said. ""For this reason, I want to thank the Prime
Minister for agreeing to accept this gift, and I also want to thank Reverend Liki Tiatia, Reverend
John Mailo, Reverend Misipauena Tagaloa, and High Chief Loa Pele Faletogo for all the good
work they have done. Reverend Tiatia and Reverend Mailo will be taking a flight to Samoa to
make the presentation to the Government of Samoa on behalf of our Samoan community on the
West Coast and also on behalf of Congresswoman Richardson and myself.""
""I especially want to thank Congresswoman Richardson for working around the clock in
support of our Samoan communities living in her district, and in Samoa and American Samoa,""
Faleomavaega continued. ""Congresswoman Richardson has stood by us every step of the way
and has left no stone unturned in getting this done. She has been staunch and solid in her
dedication to us, and has earned her rightful place in our hearts. It is my honor to welcome
Congresswoman Richardson into our Pacific Island family.""
""With so many people in need of basic supplies in Samoa, it has been a privilege to work
with Chairman Faleomavaega to assist the people of my district in making sure the items they

have collected will soon be in the hands of their families and friends,"" Congresswoman
Richardson said. ""This feat is only possible because of the dedication of Chairman
Faleomavaega and Secretary Clinton. Over 60 local organizations in the 37th district of
California, including church groups, non-profit organizations and caring others collected over
100,000 pounds of essential items to send to victims of the tragedy that recently occurred. The
lives of thousands of Samoans will be immediately and directly improved by the actions taken by
Secretary Clinton, Chairman Faleomavaega and all of us who answered the call to help. I am
proud to be a part of this exceptional team.""
""It is clear that change has come and that Secretary Clinton is restoring America's stature
once again, especially in a part of the world that the U.S. has too long neglected. We thank
Secretary Clinton for her leadership and commitment, and for standing with the people of Samoa
when they need her most, and we continue to extend our deepest condolences to the families and
friends of those who are suffering so much,"" Faleomavaega and Rep. Richardson concluded.

Speech of Senator Lugar
Foreign Assistance and Development in a New Era
Thursday, January 28, 2010
U.S. Sen. Dick Lugar will deliver the following speech tonight at the Society for International Development's annual
dinner.
I thank the Society for International Development, its members and its leadership - Betsy Bassan and Joe Feuer - for
the work they do on development issues around the world, and for organizing this annual gala. It is unfortunate that
Chairman Kerry could not be with us tonight, but I know he shares my gratitude for your recognition.
I also want to take this opportunity to thank Dr. Shah for his remarks and to recognize the efforts of USAID and its
new Administrator in responding to the tragic earthquake in Haiti. Dr. Shah has faced one of the most challenging
crises imaginable only five days after being sworn in. The job ahead of him - in Haiti and around the globe - is
monumental. I look forward to supporting his work and that of his agency in the coming years. I commend all of our
responders from all government agencies for their courage, compassion, and skill as they continue their mission in
Haiti, and I join all of you in extending our prayers to the people of that nation.
Tonight I would like to offer a few points about where we have come from and where we might be going with regard
to U.S. investments in development.
The challenges of global poverty and hunger are growing at a time when worries about the sustainability of natural
resources are increasing. Population growth and increased affluence in some parts of the globe will require that we
more than double world food production by 2050 to keep pace. At the same time, to address environmental concerns,
we will have to harvest that food from roughly the same amount of land that is in production today. The accessibility
and availability of food deeply affects the health of populations. Childhood malnutrition has lifelong consequences for
the productivity of individuals and nations. Poverty denies opportunity to the world's young people and breeds
extremism and instability that spills over borders. It is not surprising that the CIA has long tracked and analyzed
global food supplies as an indicator of potential conflict.
There is probably not a person in this room who would disagree that development is critical for U.S. national security
and that the alleviation of poverty and hunger is a key component. This is a sentiment that is shared in most parts of
our government, including the Department of Defense.
But even though the importance of advancing development goals is evident, constructing the most efficient,
accountable, and transparent means for achieving those goals is complex and challenging. Differences of opinion exist
with regard to who should be performing development functions and how these activities should be integrated into our
broader foreign policy efforts. We have not reached a consensus within our government on who should be doing what,
where, when and why.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05766534 Date: 08/31/2015
As we debate these issues, we should keep in mind that diplomacy and development are two distinct disciplines.
Although diplomacy and development often can be mutually reinforcing, at their core, they have different priorities,
resource requirements, and time horizons. Most obviously, diplomacy is far more concerned with solving immediate
problems, usually associated with countries of strategic interest. Although we hope that our development efforts will
sometimes yield short-term strategic benefits, that is not their primary purpose. In a development context, we are
willing to take a much longer view of the world and devote resources to countries of less, or even minimal, strategic
significance. We are willing to allow the diplomatic and national security benefits of development work to accrue over
time. And we are willing to engage in missions for purely altruistic reasons. These differences underscore why
development must be an independent partner of diplomacy, not merely its servant.
Reforming U.S. Foreign Assistance
Reforming U.S. foreign assistance - in both substance and architecture - has been a priority for the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee. Secretary Clinton has stated: ""I want USAID to be seen as the premier development agency in
the world."" I share that sentiment. One of the basic questions with respect to foreign aid reform is how we can best
strengthen the capacity of USAID to run effective assistance programs. During the last two decades, decision-makers
have not made it easy for the agency to perform its mission. Development resources declined precipitously in the
1990s and reorganization initiatives resulted in the agency's loss of evaluation, budget, and policy capacity. There is
broad consensus among development experts that the loss of these functions at USAID is inhibiting the success of our
development programs. Our development efforts will never be as effective as they should be if the agency that houses
most of our development expertise is cut out of relevant policy and budget decisions.
Events since 2001 have spurred greater investments in foreign assistance. But many of these resources have been
located outside of USAID. Roughly two dozen departments and agencies have taken over some aspects of foreign
assistance, including the Department of Defense and the Department of Agriculture.
The President has advocated doubling foreign assistance over time, and has announced new initiatives on food
security and health. Given the increased resources needed for these initiatives, it is crucial that the American people
and Congress have confidence that these funds will be used efficiently.
USAID must have a central role in development policy decisions. If we are to avoid inefficient experimentation, it must
have the capacity to evaluate programs and disseminate information about best practices and methods. That requires
policy makers to continue augmenting the agency's staffing and expertise. These principals are reflected in legislation
that Senator Kerry and I introduced last year, S. 1524, the Foreign Assistance Revitalization and Accountability Act.
The Administration has initiated two separate studies - the State Department's Quadrennial Diplomacy and
Development Review and the National Security Council's Presidential Study Directive on Development - in an attempt
to make recommendations on how development programs can better support U.S. foreign policy objectives. The
QDDR will not be completed until this fall and it is uncertain when, or if, we will know the outcomes of the PSD.
I am eager to review the Administration's ideas when they are ready. But in the meantime, Congress should be
offering its own ideas on how to improve our government's development capacity. The Kerry-Lugar foreign assistance
reform bill is the product of well over a year of research and analysis by Senators and their staffs. It has strong
support in the aid community. And it is co-sponsored by a bipartisan group of 23 Senators, twelve of whom are
members of the Foreign Relations Committee. This level of backing for a bill related to foreign assistance is extremely
rare. It provides an opportunity to build something approaching a consensus on this issue. I am hopeful that the
Executive Branch will recognize that a bill co-sponsored by a majority of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and
nearly a quarter of the full Senate should be given substantial weight in its review process. A strong development
agency that serves under the foreign policy guidance of the Secretary of State, as envisioned in our bill, will best
empower her to advance U.S. goals.
A Development Policy Guided by Objectives
Even as we reconsider our development architecture, it is vital that development policy is guided by objectives rather
than by how we organize our government to deliver development assistance. We should focus on the big issues - food
scarcity, poverty, disease, environmental degradation -- that prevent economic growth in a large swath of the world's
countries. Those objectives require that strategies reflect the needs of the countries we are helping rather than the
vagaries of our own budget process, which often allocates funds in response to lobbying pressures, media interest, or
political favoritism. Country strategies based on broad objectives also give us the best chance to avoid dependence on
arbitrary spending targets for specific sectors. For example, promoting food security requires investments not just in
agricultural productivity, but in clean water, infrastructure, basic and higher education, and land titling, to name just a
few factors.
The Global Food Security Act, which I authored with Senator Casey and which Senator Kerry has co-sponsored,
reflects these principles. The food price crisis that occurred in 2008 resulted from a culmination of policy choices by
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05766534 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05766534 Date: 08/31/2015
donor and recipient governments over a decades-long period. That crisis was a wakeup call for the development
community, for international donors, and for policymakers worldwide. Because achieving food security must be a
multi-sector endeavor that goes beyond simply raising crop yields, U.S. policy must seek to integrate a variety of
approaches and actors. At the same time, we do not want to delegate responsibility for food security policy to multiple
departments. That could further weaken our already fractured foreign assistance structure. That is why our bill
designates USAID, which has the broad development experience necessary, as the lead agency to implement the
strategy.
""Whole-of-Government"" in Perspective
The term ""whole-of-government"" has come into vogue in policy circles. To the extent that the term underscores the
complexity of development problems and the need to apply the talents of a diverse set of agencies to their solution, it
is useful and descriptive. Our government must have the capacity to draw on expertise to achieve vital development
missions without artificial barriers erected by agencies. Many agencies are working together successfully on
development problems in many parts of the world.
But we should not mistake the term ""whole-of-government"" for an organizational strategy. Even if multiple agencies
are making contributions, someone must be in charge, someone must coordinate the activities of all involved, and
someone must take responsibility for inefficiencies and failures.
This is especially important in a development context because of our highly fragmented aid system. The risk is that
the term ""whole-of-government,"" will be used to justify that fragmentation or preserve roles for agencies where they
are not justified. We also must be careful that the whole-of-government concept does not re-define development as a
series of technical decisions - from where to dig wells to which seeds to plant in which soils. Such a redefinition would
devalue the discipline of development, which many practitioners have spent a lifetime studying and testing. We know
from long experience that technical expertise must be grounded in an understanding of development. For example,
agricultural advancement depends as much or more on reaching women farmers, building agriculture education, and
engaging civil society in support of rural development than it does on seed quality and planting decisions. An
integrated strategy can only come from an agency that understands development is a separate discipline, as Dr. Shah
has said.
I believe the starting point for any future design of our assistance programs should not be the status quo, but rather
the period in which we had a well-functioning and well-resourced aid agency. Even if we emphasize the talents of
multiple agencies, a strong aid agency that can design integrated country-specific strategies is a key to success.
Unity of Purpose
Instead of accepting whole-of-government, or any other organizational model, as the guiding narrative, I believe
there is a more helpful way of viewing the development mission - that is ""unity-of-purpose."" We need to be unified
around common purposes for which we can marshal the appropriate level of resources and variety of approaches.
There will be situations that call for the involvement of multiple agencies under the direction of one government
entity. But, the decision to involve other government actors should be driven by the purpose. Such is clearly the case
now in Haiti. The U.S. government and international actors are unified for the purpose of disaster response. That
response involves the coordination of hundreds of organizations to rescue people and to provide basic elements
needed for survival. At some point soon, the mission will evolve from disaster response to reconstruction to
development. We should be asking whether we will be able to maintain a unity-of-purpose even as that purpose
changes.
The Lugar-Casey bill proposes that there be a unity-of-purpose around achieving global food security. Regardless of
the situation, it is the unity-of-purpose that should guide how foreign assistance is designed. I applaud Secretary
Clinton for adopting food security as a top priority. Her inter-agency team has been working diligently on its Global
Food Security and Hunger Initiative, and Congress has been responsive in appropriating funding. Many operational
decisions have yet to be made, particularly decisions relating to coordination, but I stand ready to work with the
Administration to pass the Lugar-Casey bill as soon as possible. I look forward to achieving a unity-of-purpose
between Congress and the Administration on food security.
These are not easy issues to solve. I applaud all of you here tonight for your dedication to development and your
willingness to work with Congress and the Administration as we try to rebuild our assistance infrastructure. I would
conclude with a quote from Dr. Norman Borlaug, the Nobel Laureate and Father of the Green Revolution, whose
optimism never flagged. He believed that constant striving would eventually wear down all obstacles. He said, ""I
cannot emphasize too strongly the fact that further progress depends on intelligent, integrated and persistent effort
by government leaders, statesmen, tradesmen, scientists, educators and communication agencies."" That is as true
today as when he said it 39 years ago, and I invite everyone here to make their own contributions in that spirit.

I suggest a night at the theatre, Mr Cameron
A sop to the party's Europhobes has left the Conservative leader defending the indefensible. He should be
ashamed
David Aaronovitch
On Friday morning David Cameron called upon David Miliband to apologise. On Friday evening I went to see a play. The
play was Our Class, by the Polish playwright, Tadeusz Slobodzianek.
In a series of short ""chapters"" Slobodzianek followed a group of classmates in a small Polish village from 1925 to 2002.
Like the village, the class was half Catholic and half Jewish. In 1941, as the Germans replaced the Russians as the
occupiers, almost all the Jews of the area were murdered in a single day. Slobodzianek shows what led up to the
massacre and what happened afterwards. It is unbearable.
Though the village is not named in the play, it is based on real events that took place at Jedwabne on July 10, 1941. As
Poland's Institute of National Memory concluded in 2002, on that day 40-50 Jewish men were forced to parade around the
town singing songs, and were then led to a barn on the outskirts where, one by one, they were killed with knives, axes
and cleavers and then thrown in a pit. Then 300 or more women and children were led from the town square to the barn
and locked inside. Kerosene was poured over the roof and walls and set alight. The screams could be heard from two
kilometres away; no one survived.
In 2001 it was finally acknowledged what many people had known all along. The murderers hadn't been Germans, but
local Poles, as depicted in Our Class. Alexander Kwasniewski, then the Polish President, apologised to the dead Jews
and their survivors at a ceremony in Jedwabne ""in my own name, and in the name of those Poles whose conscience is
shattered by that crime"".
History matters. Few believe that as much as the Law and Justice party of Michel Kaminski, who leads the Tory-backed
group in the European Parliament. The party's leaders have demanded apologies from the Russians for the massacre of
21,000 Polish officers at Katyn in 1940 and their references to terrible Polish historical suffering have constituted a big
part, of their political appeal.
But despite his historical sensitivity Mr Kaminski, the MEP for the Jedwabne area, did not support the 2001 apology. He
opposed it vigorously, associating himself with the ""Committee to Defend the .Good Name of Jedwabne"". Among its
leading members were the local priest, Edward Orlowski, who — asked by journalists whether he would be attending the
ceremony at which the President apologised — said: ""These are all lies. it is not my business. Germans are responsible,
so why should we apologiSe?""
Mr Kaminski developed a slightly different rationale. As he told an interviewer for a far-right newspaper, Our Poland, the
murders — which he abhorred — were the work of a few outcasts, and that he would only apologise if someone ""from the
Jewish side"" apologised for how ""the Jews"" behaved during the Soviet occupation from 1939 to 1941. Last month Mr
Kaminski (who had denied giving the interview) confirmed this position. ""If you are asking the Polish nation to apologise
for the crime made in Jedwabne,"" he said, ""you would require the whole Jewish nation to apologise for what some Jewish
communists did in Eastern Poland.""
It is this argument that so incenses me,•as it would anyone, I think, who had sat through Our Class. The idea of collective
Jewish Bolshevism was a major anti-Semitic trope before the war; it was a major element of self-justification after it.
Mr Kaminski denied the apology, denied the need for it, equated the massacre to ""Jewish actions"" and allied himself with
those who denied the massacre altogether, fulfilling the historian Pierre Vidal-Naquet's observation about patterns of
massacre denial: ""it never happened, it happened but was justified, they did it to themselves, they did it to us."" Mr
Kaminski's view was described as disgraceful by Mr Miiiband. Having read an enormous amount on Jedwabne in the last
few weeks, I think Mr Miliband is completely right — it is disgraceful. And as he might well demand of Mr Cameron: ""I
should apologise?""
But more than that, I find myself amazed by how Mr Cameron ever came to be in the position of demanding that a foreign
secretary, descended from Polish Jews, should apologise for possibly offending the sensibilities of a foreign politician who
vehemently opposed there being an apology for the massacre of Polish Jews. I think of all the things that Mr Cameron has
got right in his leadership of the. Conservatve Party and my mental jaw drops at the sheer wrongness of it.
Now Tory columnists, bioggers and activists are devoting their time to nitpicking sophistry about the nature of collective
guilt, and to attacking non-existent ""smears"" that they say have been attached to the unlovely person of Mr Kaminski.
Why?
It is true, as embattled Conservatives have argued, that many of the grand European coalitions contain people whose
history is problematic. There are odds and sods in the big conservative grouping, the EPP, and in the socialist group. But
these personalities are far outweighed by the parties of the IVIerkels and Sarkozys. The Polish member of the EPP, for
example, is the ruling free-market, non-nationalist conservative party of Donald Tusk — almost certainly the party that Mr
Cameron would join if he were a Pole. The new Tory grouping, the European Conservatives and Reformists, by contrast,
is all about odds and sods whom a continental Cameron would certainly shun, bar one organisation — the British
Conservatives.
So why get yourself into a position where you have to explain that the Latvian SS wasn't so bad really, and that Mr
Kaminski has an understandable position on collective guilt? And the answer seems to be that Mr Cameron promised his
Europhobes in his leadership campaign back in 2005 that he would leave the ""federalist"" EPP, and that the logical
outcome of this move has been the weird alliance that he now finds himself defending.
Was it all necessary? No. Was it in Britain's interests? Absolutely not. is it in the interests of progressive Conservatism?
You must be joking. So has this happened because Mr Cameron doesn't really care enough about Europe to think
through the consequences of his own lightly given promises, or because he's just as much a Euro-nutter as those sects,
the Hannanites, the Cashists and the Redwoodians?
This is the kind of advice I loathe, but I'll say it anyway. Go to see Our Class, Mr C. This is one hole you don't want to
keep digging.","UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05765099 Date: 07/31/2015

EU debate. Sid

I suggest a night at the theatre, Mr Cameron
A sop to the party's Europhobes has left the Conservative leader defending the indefensible. He should be
ashamed
David Aaronovitch
On Friday morning David Cameron called upon David Miliband to apologise. On Friday evening I went to see a play. The
play was Our Class, by the Polish playwright, Tadeusz Slobodzianek.
In a series of short ""chapters"" Slobodzianek followed a group of classmates in a small Polish village from 1925 to 2002.
Like the village, the class was half Catholic and half Jewish. In 1941, as the Germans replaced the Russians as the
occupiers, almost all the Jews of the area were murdered in a single day. Slobodzianek shows what led up to the
massacre and what happened afterwards. It is unbearable.
Though the village is not named in the play, it is based on real events that took place at Jedwabne on July 10, 1941. As
Poland's Institute of National Memory concluded in 2002, on that day 40-50 Jewish men were forced to parade around the
town singing songs, and were then led to a barn on the outskirts where, one by one, they were killed with knives, axes
and cleavers and then thrown in a pit. Then 300 or more women and children were led from the town square to the barn
and locked inside. Kerosene was poured over the roof and walls and set alight. The screams could be heard from two
kilometres away; no one survived.
In 2001 it was finally acknowledged what many people had known all along. The murderers hadn't been Germans, but
local Poles, as depicted in Our Class. Alexander Kwasniewski, then the Polish President, apologised to the dead Jews
and their survivors at a ceremony in Jedwabne ""in my own name, and in the name of those Poles whose conscience is
shattered by that crime"".
History matters. Few believe that as much as the Law and Justice party of Michel Kaminski, who leads the Tory-backed
group in the European Parliament. The party's leaders have demanded apologies from the Russians for the massacre of
21,000 Polish officers at Katyn in 1940 and their references to terrible Polish historical suffering have constituted a big
part, of their political appeal.
But despite his historical sensitivity Mr Kaminski, the MEP for the Jedwabne area, did not support the 2001 apology. He
opposed it vigorously, associating himself with the ""Committee to Defend the .Good Name of Jedwabne"". Among its
leading members were the local priest, Edward Orlowski, who — asked by journalists whether he would be attending the
ceremony at which the President apologised — said: ""These are all lies. it is not my business. Germans are responsible,
so why should we apologiSe?""
Mr Kaminski developed a slightly different rationale. As he told an interviewer for a far-right newspaper, Our Poland, the
murders — which he abhorred — were the work of a few outcasts, and that he would only apologise if someone ""from the
Jewish side"" apologised for how ""the Jews"" behaved during the Soviet occupation from 1939 to 1941. Last month Mr
Kaminski (who had denied giving the interview) confirmed this position. ""If you are asking the Polish nation to apologise
for the crime made in Jedwabne,"" he said, ""you would require the whole Jewish nation to apologise for what some Jewish
communists did in Eastern Poland.""
It is this argument that so incenses me,•as it would anyone, I think, who had sat through Our Class. The idea of collective
Jewish Bolshevism was a major anti-Semitic trope before the war; it was a major element of self-justification after it.
Mr Kaminski denied the apology, denied the need for it, equated the massacre to ""Jewish actions"" and allied himself with
those who denied the massacre altogether, fulfilling the historian Pierre Vidal-Naquet's observation about patterns of
massacre denial: ""it never happened, it happened but was justified, they did it to themselves, they did it to us."" Mr
Kaminski's view was described as disgraceful by Mr Miiiband. Having read an enormous amount on Jedwabne in the last
few weeks, I think Mr Miliband is completely right — it is disgraceful. And as he might well demand of Mr Cameron: ""I
should apologise?""

But more than that, I find myself amazed by how Mr Cameron ever came to be in the position of demanding that a foreign
secretary, descended from Polish Jews, should apologise for possibly offending the sensibilities of a foreign politician who
vehemently opposed there being an apology for the massacre of Polish Jews. I think of all the things that Mr Cameron has
got right in his leadership of the. Conservatve Party and my mental jaw drops at the sheer wrongness of it.
Now Tory columnists, bioggers and activists are devoting their time to nitpicking sophistry about the nature of collective
guilt, and to attacking non-existent ""smears"" that they say have been attached to the unlovely person of Mr Kaminski.
Why?
It is true, as embattled Conservatives have argued, that many of the grand European coalitions contain people whose
history is problematic. There are odds and sods in the big conservative grouping, the EPP, and in the socialist group. But
these personalities are far outweighed by the parties of the IVIerkels and Sarkozys. The Polish member of the EPP, for
example, is the ruling free-market, non-nationalist conservative party of Donald Tusk — almost certainly the party that Mr
Cameron would join if he were a Pole. The new Tory grouping, the European Conservatives and Reformists, by contrast,
is all about odds and sods whom a continental Cameron would certainly shun, bar one organisation — the British
Conservatives.
So why get yourself into a position where you have to explain that the Latvian SS wasn't so bad really, and that Mr
Kaminski has an understandable position on collective guilt? And the answer seems to be that Mr Cameron promised his
Europhobes in his leadership campaign back in 2005 that he would leave the ""federalist"" EPP, and that the logical
outcome of this move has been the weird alliance that he now finds himself defending.
Was it all necessary? No. Was it in Britain's interests? Absolutely not. is it in the interests of progressive Conservatism?
You must be joking. So has this happened because Mr Cameron doesn't really care enough about Europe to think
through the consequences of his own lightly given promises, or because he's just as much a Euro-nutter as those sects,
the Hannanites, the Cashists and the Redwoodians?
This is the kind of advice I loathe, but I'll say it anyway. Go to see Our Class, Mr C. This is one hole you don't want to
keep digging.

AS PREPARED
SECRETARY OF STATE HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON
REMARKS AT THE BROOKINGS INSTITUTION
WASHINGTON, DC
SEPTEMBER 18, 2009
I appreciate the opportunity to join you on the eve of the United Nations
General Assembly and to outline some key issues that the Obama
Administration will focus on in New York and in the weeks and months
ahead.
Let me begin, though, by echoing the President's statement yesterday
that he has approved the recommendations of the Pentagon and his entire
national security team to deploy a stronger and more comprehensive
missile defense system in Europe. This decision came after a lengthy
and in-depth review of our assessment of the threat posed by Iran's
ballistic missile program, and the technology that we have to confront it.
And it is a decision that will leave America stronger, and more capable
of defending our troops, our interests, and our Allies.
1
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05764620 Date: 07/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05764620 Date: 07/31/2015
Let's be clear about what this new system will do relative to the previous
program — which was many years from being deployed. With the
President's decision, we will deploy missile defense sooner than the
previous program, so that we will be able to swiftly counter the threat
posed by Iran's short and medium-range ballistic missiles.
We will deploy missile defense that is more comprehensive than the
previous program, with more interceptors in more places, and a better
capacity to protect all of our friends and allies in the region. We will
deploy technology that is actually proven so that we do not waste time or
taxpayer money, and we will preserve the flexibility to adjust our
approach to the threat as it evolves.
So make no mistake: if you support missile defense, then this is a
stronger and smarter approach than the previous program. It does what
missile defense is actually supposed to do — it defends America and our
Allies.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05764620 Date: 07/31/2015
Now I know we have heard criticism of this plan from some quarters.
But much of it is not connected to facts. We are not ""shelving"" missile
defense, we are deploying missile defense sooner than the Bush
Administration planned to, and we are deploying a more comprehensive
system. We are not reducing our capacity to protect our interests and our
Allies from Iran, we are increasing that capacity and focusing it on our
understanding of Iran's capabilities. And most of all, we would never
walk away from our Allies — instead, we are deploying a system that
enhances their security, that advances our cooperation with NATO, and
that actually places more resources in more countries.
Two of those Allies are Poland and the Czech Republic, and we deeply
appreciate their willingness to host parts of the previously planned
system. We will continue to cooperate closely with both nations — for
instance, through rotation of a Patriot battery in Poland, and close
missile defense research and development work with Czech companies.
As we explore land based interceptors going forward, we have made it
clear that those two,countries will be at the top of the list. And let me
underscore that we are bound together by our common commitment as
NATO Allies, and also by deep historical, economic, and cultural ties
that will never be broken.

Finally, let me reiterate what the President said yesterday: this decision
was not about Russia; it was about Iran and the threat that its ballistic
missile programs continue to pose. And because of this decision, we will
be in a far stronger position to deal with that threat, and to do so with
technology that works.
My main reason for being here today is to give you a review of our
agenda next week in New York. Before I get to specifics, though, I want
to share a quick story. A few days ago, a friend, knowing I was heading
to the UN General Assembly, gave me a cartoon from The New Yorker.
It showed a delegate in his seat at the United Nations passing a note to
the delegate next to him. And the caption read: ""Shhh. It's a birthday
card for Lichtenstein. Sign it and pass it on.""

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05764620 Date: 07/31/2015
Well, comic relief is essential in our line of work. But as with most
humor, this cartoon is also commentary. And it represents one view of
the United Nations — a caricature of what multilateral organizations
spend their time doing.
As President Obama leads our US delegation at this year's General
Assembly, I hope we can demonstrate that the United Nations does not
have to be just a diplomatic talk shop on Pt Avenue.
At its best, it can be an institution that brings the world's nations
together to solve global problems through adherence to rules and
principles set forth in the UN Charter. And it is the responsibility of the
192 member nations — during the General Assembly and beyond -- to
capitalize on the opportunity for global cooperation and progress that the
UN affords.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05764620 Date: 07/31/2015
I outlined earlier this summer at the Council on Foreign Relations the
Obama Administration's efforts to advance our interests and solve
today's problems through a global architecture of cooperation.
We must begin by taking responsibility ourselves — something that under
President Obama we have already begun to do on issues from climate
change to non-proliferation. And we have called on others to do the
same.
By building and strengthening partnerships, institutions, and
international regimes, we can forge a global consensus and use that
leverage to offer clear incentives to all nations to cooperate and live up
to their responsibilities, and strong disincentives to act in isolation or
provoke conflict. The United Nations and this month's General
Assembly offer a venue and a forum for nations to work together to live
up to the founding charter and abide by and enforce international rules in
service of global peace and security.

This is not only critical to the effectiveness of global institutions; it is
essential to meeting the global challenges of the 21' century. This is
what Strobe describes as ""The Great Experiment"" — and I believe it is
the heart of America's mission in the world today.
Few issues reflect the need for a global architecture of cooperation more
than nuclear non-proliferation. No issue poses a more serious threat to
our security or the world's, and it will be a main topic of discussion next
week and beyond.
The President outlined a robust and ambitious arms control and
nonproliferation agenda in Prague earlier this year that can move us
toward a world without nuclear weapons.
As the President said, this won't be easy. It might not even happen in
our lifetimes. And, as long as nuclear weapons exist in the world, the
United States will maintain a safe, secure and effective deterrent
capability.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05764620 Date: 07/31/2015
Next week, the President will chair a meeting of the U.N. Security
Council on nonproliferation and disarmament. He will emphasize the
importance of strengthening the international nuclear nonproliferation
regime — and the critical role the Council must play in enforcing
compliance with nonproliferation obligations.
The President also has asked me to lead the U.S. delegation to a
conference on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, and this will be the
first time a Secretary of State has attended. It will give me the
opportunity to underscore the importance of the CTBT to the global
nonproliferation effort and to broader U.S. security interests.
Strengthening the non-proliferation regime means working to bring
other nations into compliance. This includes North Korea and Iran. Let
me take a moment to speak about Iran, another key topic on my agenda
next week.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05764620 Date: 07/31/2015
To begin, it is important to recall what's really at issue, and what's really
at stake.
Iran has refused for years to address the international community's deep
concerns about its nuclear program, underscored repeatedly by the
International Atomic Energy Agency and the UN Security Council.
Iran's continued failure to live up to its obligations carries profound
consequences — for the security of the United States and our allies; for
progress on global non-proliferation and progress towards disarmament;
for the credibility of the Security Council and the Non-Proliferation
Treaty; and for stability in the Middle East and beyond.
Our concern is not Iran's right to develop peaceful nuclear energy, but
its responsibility to demonstrate that its program is intended exclusively
for peaceful purposes. This is not hard to do. Iran's continued refusal to
cooperate has damaged the credibility of its claim that it does not seek a
nuclear weapon.
9
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05764620 Date: 07/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05764620 Date: 07/31/2015
Iran faces a choice. The international community has made abundantly
clear what is possible for all Iranians if Iran lives up to its
responsibilities on the nuclear issue — the benefits of economic
connections to the rest of the world, cooperation on peaceful nuclear
energy, and partnership in education and science.
But there will be accompanying costs for Iran's continued defiance -
more isolation and economic pressure, and less possibility of progress
for the people of Iran.
The Obama Administration has clearly conveyed our readiness to
engage directly with Iran. We know that dialogue doesn't guarantee
success. But we also know that our past refusal to engage yielded no
progress on the nuclear issue, nor did it stem Iran's support for terrorist
groups.
Over the past eight months, the President has reached out both to the
Iranian government and people. We have made clear our desire to
resolve issues with Iran diplomatically. Iran must now decide whether
to join us in this effort.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05764620 Date: 07/31/2015
Yet, since June, we have seen the Iranian government engaged in a
mockery of the justice system, including show trials, and suppression of
free speech. The Iranian government seeks a sense of justice in the
world, but stands in the way of the justice it seeks.
Nonetheless, we remain ready to engage with Iran — not as an end in
itself, but as a means of addressing the growing concerns that we and
our international partners have about Iran's actions, especially on the
nuclear issue. In New York next week, I will meet with my counterparts
from the United Kingdom, France, Russia, China and Germany to
discuss the way forward and prepare for talks that the European Union's
Javier Solana is arranging at the beginning of October.
Our message will be clear: We are serious. We will soon see if the
Iranians are serious. This is not about process for the sake of process. In
New York, we will work with our partners to put Iran's choice into
focus and to stress that engagement must produce real results and that
we have no appetite for talk without action.

Let me also highlight a few other issues that I will be addressing at the
General Assembly and in the months ahead: Iraq, Afghanistan and
Pakistan; development; and women.
Iraq has made important strides with the support of the United States and
the international community to build a more secure and hopeful future
for its people. We look forward to the parliamentary election next
January as an important milestone in this journey, and pledge to work
with Iraqis and the international community, including the invaluable
UN Mission to Iraq, to make these elections a success.
As a result of our common efforts, our relationship with Iraq can now
enter into a period of transition as our military draws down and the role
of civilian agencies increases to better meet the needs of the future and
ensure a stable, sovereign and independent Iraq that contributes to peace
and security in the Middle East. This reflects no lessening of our
commitment — on the contrary, it demonstrates that we have entered a
new, sustained and more mature partnership that will serve both of
countries far into the future. I'm pleased that Vice President Biden,
accompanied by my Deputy Jim Steinberg, recently returned to Iraq to
continue our robust engagement with Iraq's leaders.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05764620 Date: 07/31/2015
The partnership between our countries will continue to build security
cooperation while strengthening diplomatic relations and building
stronger ties in commerce, rule of law, education, science and culture
through our Strategic Framework Agreement coordinating committee, a
session of which Prime Minister Maliki and I co-chaired in July. [We'll
seek to hold another session in the coming months].
Also on my docket for the General Assembly will be meetings related to
Afghanistan and Pakistan. President Obama has stated our core goal: to
disrupt, dismantle, and ultimately defeat al-Qaida and its extremist
allies, and to prevent their return to either country. This is a goal we
share with Afghanistan, with Pakistan and with the international
community. In fact, pursuing al-Qaida and the Taliban was the basis of
the original UN resolutions that authorized U.S. military action after the
September 1 1 th attacks and created ISAF, the International Security
Assistance Force of 42 nations helping Afghans secure their country.
13

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05764620 Date: 07/31/2015
Our long-term security, and that of our friends around the world, is
connected to the security and well-being of the people of Afghanistan
and Pakistan. To effectively squeeze the extremists fighting to
destabilize both countries, the Afghan and Pakistani governments must
be better able to secure their territory from extremists and meet the basic
needs of their populations.
The recent Afghan elections at once illustrate the promise and the
challenges of Afghanistan. Alongside our partners and the UN, we will
continue to encourage all parties to respect the international and Afghan
electoral institutions charged with determining the final outcome of the
election process. When the next president is inaugurated, we will work
to step up the level of international engagement with the new
government in a strong partnership to strengthen governance at all
levels.
As we address these urgent challenges, we will also work on other issues
that have implications for American security and interests. Following up
on my trip to Africa last month, and the President's visit to Ghana earlier
in the year, he will host a lunch for leaders of sub-Saharan Africa during
the General Assembly. I will meet with Costa Rican President Oscar
Arias to continue our joint efforts to resolve the crisis in Honduras and

help that country restore the democratic constitutional order. I will also
be meeting with donors and other stakeholders committed to helping
Haiti respond to the economic dislocation caused by the global
economic crisis and the hurricane. And I will continue discussions with
our allies and other partners in Asia about the situation in Burma.
If the global architecture of cooperation demands responsibility of us
and our partners, it also offers opportunities. Just as we are focusing
intensively on urgent challenges like Iran, Iraq, and Afghanistan and
Pakistan, so too are we pursuing a positive agenda devoted to expanding
opportunity so that more people in more places can fulfill their dreams
and live up to their God-given potential. And I will focus considerable
attention on two areas of opportunity — development and women.
Many of you have heard me describe our plans to integrate diplomacy
and development as two of the three pillars of our foreign policy, along
with defense.

I have talked in different venues about the Obama Administration's
commitment to leading with diplomacy and engaging other nations --
with and beyond government. Next week, I will outline how we will
approach development in tandem with our diplomacy — to be effective
and efficient and enable the State Department, USAID, and the
Millennium Challenge Corporation to pursue and execute 21st century
foreign policy goals.
The foundation for our approach will be principles that will move us
away from top-down assistance that too often fails to meet the needs of
those we are attempting to help, or has only short-term effect. To solve
the complex problems of today's world — where issues like poverty,
hunger, health, and climate change intersect — we want to focus on root
causes, and on country-driven efforts that are comprehensive, last over
time, leverage existing multi-lateral institutions and foster new
partnerships, and coordinate donors and stakeholders strategically.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05764620 Date: 07/31/2015
I will have the chance to detail this approach during my stay in New
York, and I also look forward to highlighting these issues when I
participate in an event that the UN Secretary General will host on food
security.
To successfully integrate our diplomacy and development goals at the
State Department and USAID, we have launched a Quadrennial
Diplomacy and Development Review — and, I regret to say that, in so
doing, we have added another acronym to the State lexicon: QDDR.
The QDDR, led by Deputy Secretary of State Jack Lew, is a broad
examination of our structure, policies, and budget, and will lead to better
accountability and measurable results throughout the department.
Finally, our delegation, and I personally, will work to advance
international efforts to recognize women as key drivers of economic
progress and social stability, as well as to address impediments to
women's empowerment and advancement, particularly sexual and
gender-based violence.

I will chair a session of the Security Council and will speak on behalf of
the adoption of a resolution on ""women, peace and security"" which will
endorse concrete measures to implement Security Council Resolution
1820 and address sexual and gender-based violence as a tactic of war.
I saw the scale of misery caused by this violence on my recent trip to the
Democratic Republic of Congo, where I met with rape survivors as well
as those trying to assist them.
Next week, I will be speaking with other foreign ministers and heads of
state about strategies to end this violence and to ensure that those who
commit atrocities are prosecuted and not treated with impunity.
I will also work with women leaders at the General Assembly to
highlight the importance of raising the status of girls and women and
investing in their potential — through education, economic development,
and health care. If women are free from violence, and accorded their
rights, they can contribute to their local economies and become change
agents generating greater prosperity and stability for their families,
communities, and societies as a whole.

Every day, I go to work at the State Department and am reminded that
the world has given us no shortage of urgent crises or long-range
challenges. Our agenda is full and it is ambitious — from Northeast Asia
to sub-Saharan Africa to Europe and the Americas. And we will remain
vigilant and pro-active about all of the issues, even as our plate seems to
get fuller by the day. And I will be relying on all of you to share your
expertise and advice in helping us do our jobs as well as we can to serve
our nation and the American people.
At this time of year, as we contemplate the agenda at the UN next week,
and what the world will hold in the months and years beyond, it seems
appropriate to think of new beginnings. Not only because the nations of
the world are about to meet — which is an opportunity -- but because we
are also celebrating the end of Ramadan and the beginning of the Jewish
High Holy Days.
It is a time of reflection and renewal for hundreds of millions of our
fellow citizens around the globe. A time when we can borrow from all of
the world's great faiths to take stock, re-assess, and re-commit ourselves
to the values and ideals that move us forward. And it is in that spirit that
I am approaching the General Assembly and the months ahead.

Hillary's Moment: Clinton Faces the World
By Joe Klein
Time Magazine
Wednesday, Nov. 04, 2009
It was Halloween night in Jerusalem, and Benjamin Netanyahu came dressed as a peacemaker. ""We're prepared to start
peace talks immediately,"" the notoriously reluctant Israeli Prime Minister proclaimed, with U.S. Secretary of State Hillary
Clinton standing at his side, poker-faced. ""I think we should ... get on it and get with it.""
It was a ploy, of course. The Palestinians were tangled up in themselves, yet again. They had elections looming, and their
leader, Mahmoud Abbas, had to hang tough: he was demanding a total freeze to Israeli settlement-building on the West
Bank — which was precisely what the Obama Administration had previously said it favored. Netanyahu was offering a
partial freeze, not including new settlements in East Jerusalem, the desired capital of a future Palestinian state. This was
a nonstarter for the Palestinians, but it had the holographic glow of a step forward. It was an ""unprecedented"" offer,
Netanyahu trumpeted, with the joy of a chess master springing a trap.(See photos from 60 years of Israel.)
It was a tough moment for Clinton, playing second fiddle at the Bibi-does-Gandhi show. President Barack Obama had
softened his language on the settlements a few weeks earlier: instead of a total freeze, he had talked about Israeli
""restraint"" in settlement-building. And now Clinton seemed to cement the Administration's retreat, agreeing that
Netanyahu's proposal was, indeed, ""unprecedented,"" even though the U.S. still favored a total freeze. The most
important thing, she added, was for the parties to get to the table as quickly as possible. The onus was back on the
Palestinians — and the Palestinians quickly expressed outrage at the Obama Administration's retreat. Their Arab
neighbors soon joined in, causing Clinton to backtrack two days later, telling reporters the Israeli plan ""falls far short"" of
U.S. expectations, although she still insisted on calling it ""unprecedented,"" which was neither diplomatic nor wise.
Suddenly the Obama Administration seemed wobbly on the Middle East; clearly, Clinton had been too bullish on
Netanyahu's proposal (which had been negotiated over months with Middle East envoy George Mitchell and was seen,
privately, by the Americans as real progress). But the Administration's mission was to get the parties into peace talks
without preconditions. The Israelis were now in favor of talks. The Palestinians were setting preconditions. And Clinton
had violated an essential rule of her job: boring is almost always better.(See photos from the life and career of former
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.)
Clinton's Three Qualities
For the past 40 years, the awkward Middle East press conference has helped define the job of Secretary of State. You go
to Jerusalem or Ramallah; you stand there ""guardedly optimistic"" in public; in private, you try to move a comma, but the
Israelis or Palestinians move, a semicolon to block your comma. The result is almost always the same: gridlock. The
breakthroughs, when they come, emanate from others. Walter Cronkite asks Anwar Sadat if he'd be willing to go to
Jerusalem ... and Sadat, to everyone's surprise, says yes. The Israelis and Palestinians hold secret meetings in Oslo and
reach what appears to be a breakthrough — they're talking! — which then becomes another dead end.
The job of Secretary of State is more thankless than glamorous; in some ways, the Department of State, a noble antique,
is still trying to come to terms with the invention of the telephone. In an era when Twitter haiku-messaging rules,
diplomacy moves at the speed, and requires the nuanced complexity, of literature. Power has drifted from State to the
National Security Council and the Pentagon, especially in wartime. Only a few of Clinton's recent predecessors have
distinguished themselves. Henry Kissinger, a National Security Adviser who belatedly became Secretary of State, was
Richard Nixon's schizophrenic alter ego; George Shultz was a strong policy voice in the Reagan Administration; James
Baker had clout because he was George H.W. Bush's best friend and a world-class dealmaker. Most of the others have
been frustrated or forgettable. And yet this is Hillary Clinton we're talking about — the second most popular American in
the world, an eternally compelling and supremely talented character, the subject of constant speculation, a walking
headline. Her very presence in the job makes it crucial once more.
It is a cliché to say that by naming Clinton, Obama brought his most popular potential opponent into the tent. The
conventional wisdom, too cynical by half, is that he thereby succeeded in neutering her, a theory bolstered by Clinton's
reticence during her first nine months on the job, with special envoys like Mitchell and Richard Holbrooke doing the
heavy lifting of diplomacy. But by naming Clinton, Obama also gave her great power, which cuts both ways: if she
becomes dissatisfied with her role or the Administration's policies, she can become a torpedo aimed at the Oval Office.
Colin Powell had similar power and a real gripe — the Iraq war — but never used it. Clinton has no such gripe, but as the
Obama Administration settles in and policy differences begin to emerge among the key players, the Powell conundrum
looms: How will Clinton choose to use her power? How will Obama react if and when she does?
Traditionally, the Secretary of State is judged on his or her ability to formulate policy, negotiate deals and manage the
striped-pants bureaucracy. Clinton has no history as a global strategist, although her performance in the 2008 campaign
indicates that she is a bit more conservative than the President, more the foreign policy realist than the Wilsonian
idealist. It is also too early to judge her skill as a manager or negotiator — although her performance in Jerusalem
indicates that she needs a few lessons in Middle East Haggling 101.
There are, however, three qualities that could make her a memorable Secretary of State. She brings a vision of
departmental reform — the need to elevate foreign aid programs to the same status and rigorous scrutiny as diplomacy
— that could change striped pants into chinos in the developing world. She is also the first elected politician to hold the
office since Edmund Muskie briefly did during the Carter Administration, which has enabled her to better understand
and interact with the politicians who run places like Afghanistan and Pakistan. But most important, she is an
international celebrity with a much higher profile than any of her recent predecessors and the ability — second only to
the President's — to change negative attitudes about the U.S. abroad.
She has the potential to become the most powerful public diplomat the U.S. has fielded in quite some time, although
her performance so far, at home and abroad, has occasionally been perplexing. At home, she has often seemed
tentative and deferential. In a conversation with Secretary of Defense Robert Gates aired by CNN in early October,
Clinton's cautious formality took a backseat to Gates' brisk, humorous confidence on policy issues. Abroad, she seems
far more confident, at times to the point of recklessness, as in Jerusalem. (See photos of the last days of Hillary Clinton's
campaign.)
Independence and Candor
In the last week of October, Secretary Clinton moved squarely to the center of the world stage, attempting, at the
behest of her special envoys, to improve the rocky alliance with Pakistan and nudge the Middle East pugilists into talks.
In the course of the trip, there were the first stray wisps of a hint that Clinton wanted to begin asserting her
independence, as the Administration, facing roadblocks across the world, struggled for a firmer foreign policy tone after
an opening nine months that might be called the Rodney King — ""Can't we all just get along?"" — phase.
During her three days in Pakistan, she ran a gauntlet of town-hall meetings and media interviews that may have been
unprecedented, to use the word of the week, for a U.S. Secretary of State. The trip, planned by Holbrooke and Pakistan
specialist Vali Nasr, offered an unusually subtle itinerary for a U.S. diplomatic mission. A visit to a Sufi mosque that had
been bombed by Sunni extremists, for example, sent a powerful message to Pakistan's moderate Islamic majority. ""We
saw her praying there,"" an academic named Shala Aziz told me, ""and, for the first time, I'm thinking, The Americans have
hearts.""(See photos of the suicide bombings in Islamabad.)
The big news was that Clinton allowed herself to be hammered with hostile questions from students, talk-show hosts
and Pashturi elders -- and that, on occasion, she pushed back, raising incredibly sensitive issues, like why no one in the
Pakistani government knew where Osama bin Laden was, even though he had been in the country since 2002. Press
accounts either emphasized the embarrassment of a Secretary of State's getting pummeled or fixed on Clinton's
undiplomatic bluntness. But they missed the point: her candor, her willingness to listen to and acknowledge criticism,
had begun to undermine the prevailing Pakistani image of the U.S. as arrogant and bossy, more interested in having the
Pakistani military fight its war against al-Qaeda and the Taliban than in having a true strategic partnership. The contrast
was especially sharp after George W. Bush's eight years of unqualified support for the military dictatorship of Pervez
Musharraf. ""In the past, when the Americans came, they would talk to the generals and go home,"" said Farahnaz
Ispahani, a government spokeswoman and Member of Parliament. ""Clinton's willingness to meet with everyone, hostile
or not, has made a big impression — and because she's Hillary Clinton, with a real history of affinity for this country, it
means so much more.""
Transformative Experience
There are no toasts at state dinners in Pakistan, because there is no alcohol. There are opening statements, though, and
Clinton's — delivered impromptu on the first night of her trip after tossing aside her notes — was surprisingly emotional.
Earlier in the day, President Asif Ali Zardari, the widower of Benazir Bhutto, had presented the Secretary with an album
of photos from her first visit to Pakistan, in 1995, and a framed photo of Bhutto and her two sons with Clinton and
daughter Chelsea. ""It did bring tears to my eyes,"" Clinton said at the state dinner in her honor at the presidential palace,
""because I so admired your wife. She gave her life ..."" She faltered then, choking up, but quickly pulled herself together,
talking about the ""reasons why we do what we do — to provide opportunities for all.""
Clinton's first trip to Pakistan as First Lady in 1995 had been a transformative experience for her — the beginning, I
believe, of the•process that made her a plausible candidate for Secretary of State. I traveled with her on that trip; when
we set off, she seemed depressed and even more private than usual. The Democrats had cratered in the 1994
congressional elections, and she had been trounced in her efforts to enact a universal health care plan. It was a very
personal defeat; as Clinton traveled the country trying to sell the plan, crowds shouted her down and cursed her.
Privately she admitted she was shocked by the hatred. The trip to South Asia seemed a bit of a vacation — it was
Chelsea's spring break — but also a retreat to a more demure, First Lady–like role after two years as health care policy
czar, although it proceeded in a decidedly wonky, Hillarian fashion. Jackie Kennedy had gone to India and famously
ridden an elephant; Hillary Clinton traveled to five countries and packed her schedule with visits to NGOs.
""That was the greatest trip, just unbelievable,"" Clinton says now. We were sitting in her hotel suite the day after her
Jerusalem gaffe, the Secretary in an electric-blue shift rather than her usual formal jacket and pants. She was wearing
glasses and appeared rather freckly without her makeup. ""I guess that trip has animated and informed everything I've
done since,"" she said. She emerged from the trip reinvigorated, with a new mission. By the end of 1995, at the U.N.
Conference on Women in Beijing, the First Lady had propounded a new Clinton Doctrine: ""Women's rights are human
rights.""(See photos of Beijing's changing skyline.)
Clinton is not an easy interview. She is preternaturally cautious, a consequence of her Methodist propriety and 20 years
of insane public scrutiny. She does not like to talk about herself, but she did tell me one interesting story about Bhutto.
When her husband was governor of Arkansas, she and Bill and Chelsea visited London and stood on the sidewalk outside
Bhutto's hotel, waiting for the then Pakistani Prime Minister to arrive. ""She was wearing a yellow embroidered shalwar
kameez with a chiffon scarf. I was just a fan, standing on the sidewalk with everyone else. It was the only time I ever did
anything like that,"" Clinton says.
When Clinton and Bhutto met formally, on the first day of the 1995 trip, they hit it off immediately, in part because
Bhutto was also obsessed with the impact the Islamist tide was having on women and children. I remember asking
Bhutto that day what the biggest change in her country had been over the past 25 years, and she said, ""I used to be able
to walk down the street wearing jeans, without a headscarf. Now I can't."" When I asked her why, she said — bluntly —
""The Saudis,"" who had been aggressively funding religious schools. Of course, Bhutto's acquiescence to, and
participation in, the general corruption of the Pakistani government was part of the reason public schools were so
inadequate and madrasahs became popular. (See photos from the aftermath of Benazir Bhutto's assassination in 2007.)
Ironically, the rise of Sunni extremist groups like al-Qaeda has brought Clinton's interests — microfinance, education and
health care — to the center of national-security policy for the first time. The impetus came not from the State
Department but from the military, where counterinsurgency doctrine demanded that social services in war zones -
schools, justice, economic development — reinforce the military's efforts to secure the population. As a result, there
was immediate chemistry between Clinton and General David Petraeus, author of the Army's counterinsurgency
manual, who became one of her prime military mentors when she served on the Senate Armed Services Committee. At
one point, well before Obama made his presidential intentions known, I asked Petraeus if there was any potential
Democratic candidate who understood how his mind worked, and he said, ""You mean, aside from Hillary?""
It was Clinton who brought together Petraeus and Holbrooke (""my two alpha males,"" she calls them) for the first time -
at her home in Washington on the Friday before the Obama Inauguration. The affection and respect she gained for the
military while serving in the Senate has helped make the relationship between State and the Pentagon less fraught than
usual — although Defense Secretary Gates' insistence on the need for bigger State Department budgets hasn't hurt. In
fact, relations with the Pentagon have gone smoother, at times, than Clinton's relationship with the White House staff.
Clinton was particularly irritated by the ridiculously strict vetting process that thwarted her favored candidate for USAID
director, Paul Farmer, from getting the job. ""It was all sorts of niggling things,"" says a Clinton adviser, ""like, Farmer had
at one point brought more than $10,000 in cash into Haiti. The money was for a needle-exchange program, but the
amount was illegal.""
Another of Clinton's military mentors, retired General Jack Keane, once told me, ""I'm a Republican. I disagree with her
about practically everything, but she'd make a hell of a Commander in Chief."" There is a palpable toughness to the
woman, a hard edge that contrasts with the President's instinctive impulse toward conciliation. One of the sharpest
exchanges of the presidential campaign came when Obama accused Clinton of echoing the ""bluster"" of George W. Bush
after she said the U.S. would be able to ""obliterate"" Iran if it used nuclear weapons against Israel. Clinton's edgier tone
has been evident from the start of the Administration: she took a sharper position than the President on an Israeli
settlement freeze by claiming, in May, that Obama wanted ""to see a stop to settlements. Not some settlements, not
outposts, not natural-growth exceptions."" And then, in Jerusalem, her use of the word unprecedented seemed a
rhetorical leap beyond the No Drama ground rules.(Read ""Clinton's Collateral Damage."")
The White House was not entirely thrilled with either statement. But then the White House staff is several steps
removed from a negotiating process. The Palestinians are weak and divided. The Israelis have been difficult, as always:
whenever Mitchell raises East Jerusalem in talks with the Israeli Foreign Minister, the Israeli stands up and walks out of
the room. Despite Netanyahu's momentary, tactical enthusiasm for peace talks, his Likud Party has always favored the
de facto incorporation of Palestinian lands into the state of Israel.
Hillary's Choice
The tensions between the White House and State raise a fascinating question going forward. Obama and Clinton are in
substantive agreement on the President's diplomacy-first philosophy and on most policy issues — although neither is
willing to disclose the content of their private conversations — but style often predicts substance in foreign policy;
neither Obama's gauziness nor Clinton's inconsistent bluntness overseas seems particularly solid. There is a growing
perception that the Administration's policies have been thwarted across the board: Afghanistan is a mess, Iran seems
ready to scuttle the nuclear negotiations, there's no progress in the Middle East, the Syrians and North Koreans remain
recalcitrant, the Russians have been offered a freebie on missile defense, and the Chinese have been given a pass on
human rights with no apparent quid pro quos.
The White House argues that some progress has been made: Iran is on the defensive, and North Korea has said it will
return to the six-party talks. Clinton argues, correctly, about the need for ""strategic patience."" But the only thing Obama
really has to show for his efforts so far is a Nobel Prize for Potential and — no small thing — the wisdom to have
refrained from doing anything so wildly stupid as invading Iraq. The President has been willing to use military force -
the Predator drones that have decimated al-Qaeda's leadership testify to his lack of squeamishness — but this
Administration is supposed to be about the efficacy of using subtler expressions of.U.S. power. That doesn't happen
overnight, but for Obama's policies to be considered a success, it has to happen sooner or later, in a way that can be
explained to the public.
There is also a growing sense that the President's inexperience is beginning to show — not in his overall policy, which
represents the views of a broad, moderate national-security consensus ranging from Brent Scowcroft to John Kerry, but
in his execution of the details. The Afghan strategy review has been too public and taken too long; the Middle East peace
hunt has become a wild goose chase. A letter to Iran's Supreme Leader is a productive gesture only if it gets a response;
if it doesn't, it seems weak and supplicatory. A call for the Israelis to freeze settlements is effective only if it is
accompanied by the credible threat of a reduction in aid. ""You can't be seen pushing countries around — demanding
[that] Israel freeze settlements, demanding that Hamid Karzai reform his government — and not get results,"" says Leslie
H. Gelb, author of Power Rules. ""The leaders of these countries are tough, successful politicians, and they'll begin to take
you less seriously."" (See photos from the 1979 revolution in Iran.)
Clinton is unwilling to acknowledge these problems, and her staff is loath to admit her occasional mistakes. Her praise
for the President is fulsome, and aides say the relationship with Obama really — really — is strong. But there are also
burblings and emanations from Clinton's staff and friends, Foggy Bottom body language, that suggest there is a need for
the Administration to produce a second act after the Rodney King phase. And the White House is perplexed by the
uncharacteristic lack of discipline indicated by Clinton's occasional overseas gaffes.
These tensions are well within the boundaries of normal, creative policymaking. There is absolutely no indication that
the Secretary is frustrated to the point of jumping ship — or returning to politics as a candidate for governor of New
York, as has been rumored. Quite the contrary, she seems intent on making history as Secretary of State. To do that,
though, she will have to have the same authority at home as she has abroad. She will have to become the President's
primary foreign policy voice. Over the first nine months of the Obama Administration, seven different Obama officials
have spoken on the Sunday talk shows about foreign policy. Clinton has been on each of the Sunday shows once. ""Either
you have one person sending the foreign policy message, with the clear approval of the President,"" says a former
Republican Secretary of State, ""or there is no message.""(See photos from eight months of Obama's diplomacy.)
Aides to Obama say they would like to see her on the Sunday shows more often. (Indeed, Clinton's staff acknowledged
that she was asked to appear two additional times but was traveling and unable to do so.) Ultimately, though, television
is a metaphor for the larger questions that need to be resolved: How much can these former rivals — both extremely
guarded and private people — really trust each other; and, if not Clinton, who will emerge as the President's alter ego
on foreign policy? At this point, the strongest member of Obama's national-security team is Gates — but he's a
Republican and an unlikely spokesman or presidential confidant on anything beyond Pentagon issues. General Jim Jones
has settled in as National Security Adviser, but he's not a political animal — and every President needs a close foreign
policy adviser who understands the intersection of long-term strategy, politics and diplomatic chess.
Clinton's value to the Administration was clear in Pakistan. She wowed a public so skeptical that it had been questioning
the $7.5 billion in purely economic and humanitarian aid the Administration had promised. ""How much damage control
have you been able to do on this trip?"" asked Meher Bokhari, a television-news-show host, at the end of Clinton's
meeting with Pakistani women. The Secretary seemed nonplussed by the bluntness of the question. ""I don't know,"" she
said. ""I hope some.""
Afterward, I asked Bokhari to answer her own question. ""Well, this trip was long overdue,"" she said. ""The Pakistani
people really needed to talk to an American about our concerns — the strings attached to aid programs, the drone
attacks, their history of support for the military dictatorship. And it needs to be followed up. But if you ask me about the
damage control"" — she paused, thinking it through — ""I'd have to say a lot. She accomplished a lot.""
In the end, though, Clinton's success will be determined by whether she can expand her role beyond public diplomat.
She will have to become a more sure-handed negotiator and, most important, a trusted adviser to a President who
knows where he wants to go in the world but hasn't quite figured out how to get there.","UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05765145 Date: 07/31/2015

Hillary's Moment: Clinton Faces the World

idealist. It is also too early to judge her skill as a manager or negotiator — although her performance in Jerusalem
indicates that she needs a few lessons in Middle East Haggling 101.
There are, however, three qualities that could make her a memorable Secretary of State. She brings a vision of
departmental reform — the need to elevate foreign aid programs to the same status and rigorous scrutiny as diplomacy
— that could change striped pants into chinos in the developing world. She is also the first elected politician to hold the
office since Edmund Muskie briefly did during the Carter Administration, which has enabled her to better understand
and interact with the politicians who run places like Afghanistan and Pakistan. But most important, she is an
international celebrity with a much higher profile than any of her recent predecessors and the ability — second only to
the President's — to change negative attitudes about the U.S. abroad.
She has the potential to become the most powerful public diplomat the U.S. has fielded in quite some time, although
her performance so far, at home and abroad, has occasionally been perplexing. At home, she has often seemed
tentative and deferential. In a conversation with Secretary of Defense Robert Gates aired by CNN in early October,
Clinton's cautious formality took a backseat to Gates' brisk, humorous confidence on policy issues. Abroad, she seems
far more confident, at times to the point of recklessness, as in Jerusalem. (See photos of the last days of Hillary Clinton's
campaign.)
Independence and Candor
In the last week of October, Secretary Clinton moved squarely to the center of the world stage, attempting, at the
behest of her special envoys, to improve the rocky alliance with Pakistan and nudge the Middle East pugilists into talks.
In the course of the trip, there were the first stray wisps of a hint that Clinton wanted to begin asserting her
independence, as the Administration, facing roadblocks across the world, struggled for a firmer foreign policy tone after
an opening nine months that might be called the Rodney King — ""Can't we all just get along?"" — phase.
During her three days in Pakistan, she ran a gauntlet of town-hall meetings and media interviews that may have been
unprecedented, to use the word of the week, for a U.S. Secretary of State. The trip, planned by Holbrooke and Pakistan

specialist Vali Nasr, offered an unusually subtle itinerary for a U.S. diplomatic mission. A visit to a Sufi mosque that had
been bombed by Sunni extremists, for example, sent a powerful message to Pakistan's moderate Islamic majority. ""We
saw her praying there,"" an academic named Shala Aziz told me, ""and, for the first time, I'm thinking, The Americans have
hearts.""(See photos of the suicide bombings in Islamabad.)
The big news was that Clinton allowed herself to be hammered with hostile questions from students, talk-show hosts
and Pashturi elders -- and that, on occasion, she pushed back, raising incredibly sensitive issues, like why no one in the
Pakistani government knew where Osama bin Laden was, even though he had been in the country since 2002. Press
accounts either emphasized the embarrassment of a Secretary of State's getting pummeled or fixed on Clinton's
undiplomatic bluntness. But they missed the point: her candor, her willingness to listen to and acknowledge criticism,
had begun to undermine the prevailing Pakistani image of the U.S. as arrogant and bossy, more interested in having the
Pakistani military fight its war against al-Qaeda and the Taliban than in having a true strategic partnership. The contrast
was especially sharp after George W. Bush's eight years of unqualified support for the military dictatorship of Pervez
Musharraf. ""In the past, when the Americans came, they would talk to the generals and go home,"" said Farahnaz
Ispahani, a government spokeswoman and Member of Parliament. ""Clinton's willingness to meet with everyone, hostile
or not, has made a big impression — and because she's Hillary Clinton, with a real history of affinity for this country, it
means so much more.""
Transformative Experience
There are no toasts at state dinners in Pakistan, because there is no alcohol. There are opening statements, though, and
Clinton's — delivered impromptu on the first night of her trip after tossing aside her notes — was surprisingly emotional.
Earlier in the day, President Asif Ali Zardari, the widower of Benazir Bhutto, had presented the Secretary with an album
of photos from her first visit to Pakistan, in 1995, and a framed photo of Bhutto and her two sons with Clinton and
daughter Chelsea. ""It did bring tears to my eyes,"" Clinton said at the state dinner in her honor at the presidential palace,
""because I so admired your wife. She gave her life ..."" She faltered then, choking up, but quickly pulled herself together,
talking about the ""reasons why we do what we do — to provide opportunities for all.""
Clinton's first trip to Pakistan as First Lady in 1995 had been a transformative experience for her — the beginning, I
believe, of the•process that made her a plausible candidate for Secretary of State. I traveled with her on that trip; when
we set off, she seemed depressed and even more private than usual. The Democrats had cratered in the 1994
congressional elections, and she had been trounced in her efforts to enact a universal health care plan. It was a very
personal defeat; as Clinton traveled the country trying to sell the plan, crowds shouted her down and cursed her.
Privately she admitted she was shocked by the hatred. The trip to South Asia seemed a bit of a vacation — it was
Chelsea's spring break — but also a retreat to a more demure, First Lady–like role after two years as health care policy
czar, although it proceeded in a decidedly wonky, Hillarian fashion. Jackie Kennedy had gone to India and famously
ridden an elephant; Hillary Clinton traveled to five countries and packed her schedule with visits to NGOs.
""That was the greatest trip, just unbelievable,"" Clinton says now. We were sitting in her hotel suite the day after her
Jerusalem gaffe, the Secretary in an electric-blue shift rather than her usual formal jacket and pants. She was wearing
glasses and appeared rather freckly without her makeup. ""I guess that trip has animated and informed everything I've
done since,"" she said. She emerged from the trip reinvigorated, with a new mission. By the end of 1995, at the U.N.
Conference on Women in Beijing, the First Lady had propounded a new Clinton Doctrine: ""Women's rights are human
rights.""(See photos of Beijing's changing skyline.)
Clinton is not an easy interview. She is preternaturally cautious, a consequence of her Methodist propriety and 20 years
of insane public scrutiny. She does not like to talk about herself, but she did tell me one interesting story about Bhutto.
When her husband was governor of Arkansas, she and Bill and Chelsea visited London and stood on the sidewalk outside
Bhutto's hotel, waiting for the then Pakistani Prime Minister to arrive. ""She was wearing a yellow embroidered shalwar
kameez with a chiffon scarf. I was just a fan, standing on the sidewalk with everyone else. It was the only time I ever did
anything like that,"" Clinton says.
When Clinton and Bhutto met formally, on the first day of the 1995 trip, they hit it off immediately, in part because

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05765145 Date: 07/31/2015
Bhutto was also obsessed with the impact the Islamist tide was having on women and children. I remember asking
Bhutto that day what the biggest change in her country had been over the past 25 years, and she said, ""I used to be able
to walk down the street wearing jeans, without a headscarf. Now I can't."" When I asked her why, she said — bluntly —
""The Saudis,"" who had been aggressively funding religious schools. Of course, Bhutto's acquiescence to, and
participation in, the general corruption of the Pakistani government was part of the reason public schools were so
inadequate and madrasahs became popular. (See photos from the aftermath of Benazir Bhutto's assassination in 2007.)
Ironically, the rise of Sunni extremist groups like al-Qaeda has brought Clinton's interests — microfinance, education and
health care — to the center of national-security policy for the first time. The impetus came not from the State
Department but from the military, where counterinsurgency doctrine demanded that social services in war zones -
schools, justice, economic development — reinforce the military's efforts to secure the population. As a result, there
was immediate chemistry between Clinton and General David Petraeus, author of the Army's counterinsurgency
manual, who became one of her prime military mentors when she served on the Senate Armed Services Committee. At
one point, well before Obama made his presidential intentions known, I asked Petraeus if there was any potential
Democratic candidate who understood how his mind worked, and he said, ""You mean, aside from Hillary?""
It was Clinton who brought together Petraeus and Holbrooke (""my two alpha males,"" she calls them) for the first time -
at her home in Washington on the Friday before the Obama Inauguration. The affection and respect she gained for the
military while serving in the Senate has helped make the relationship between State and the Pentagon less fraught than
usual — although Defense Secretary Gates' insistence on the need for bigger State Department budgets hasn't hurt. In
fact, relations with the Pentagon have gone smoother, at times, than Clinton's relationship with the White House staff.
Clinton was particularly irritated by the ridiculously strict vetting process that thwarted her favored candidate for USAID
director, Paul Farmer, from getting the job. ""It was all sorts of niggling things,"" says a Clinton adviser, ""like, Farmer had
at one point brought more than $10,000 in cash into Haiti. The money was for a needle-exchange program, but the
amount was illegal.""
Another of Clinton's military mentors, retired General Jack Keane, once told me, ""I'm a Republican. I disagree with her
about practically everything, but she'd make a hell of a Commander in Chief."" There is a palpable toughness to the
woman, a hard edge that contrasts with the President's instinctive impulse toward conciliation. One of the sharpest
exchanges of the presidential campaign came when Obama accused Clinton of echoing the ""bluster"" of George W. Bush
after she said the U.S. would be able to ""obliterate"" Iran if it used nuclear weapons against Israel. Clinton's edgier tone
has been evident from the start of the Administration: she took a sharper position than the President on an Israeli
settlement freeze by claiming, in May, that Obama wanted ""to see a stop to settlements. Not some settlements, not
outposts, not natural-growth exceptions."" And then, in Jerusalem, her use of the word unprecedented seemed a
rhetorical leap beyond the No Drama ground rules.(Read ""Clinton's Collateral Damage."")
The White House was not entirely thrilled with either statement. But then the White House staff is several steps
removed from a negotiating process. The Palestinians are weak and divided. The Israelis have been difficult, as always:
whenever Mitchell raises East Jerusalem in talks with the Israeli Foreign Minister, the Israeli stands up and walks out of
the room. Despite Netanyahu's momentary, tactical enthusiasm for peace talks, his Likud Party has always favored the
de facto incorporation of Palestinian lands into the state of Israel.
Hillary's Choice
The tensions between the White House and State raise a fascinating question going forward. Obama and Clinton are in
substantive agreement on the President's diplomacy-first philosophy and on most policy issues — although neither is
willing to disclose the content of their private conversations — but style often predicts substance in foreign policy;
neither Obama's gauziness nor Clinton's inconsistent bluntness overseas seems particularly solid. There is a growing
perception that the Administration's policies have been thwarted across the board: Afghanistan is a mess, Iran seems
ready to scuttle the nuclear negotiations, there's no progress in the Middle East, the Syrians and North Koreans remain
recalcitrant, the Russians have been offered a freebie on missile defense, and the Chinese have been given a pass on
human rights with no apparent quid pro quos.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05765145 Date: 07/31/2015
The White House argues that some progress has been made: Iran is on the defensive, and North Korea has said it will
return to the six-party talks. Clinton argues, correctly, about the need for ""strategic patience."" But the only thing Obama
really has to show for his efforts so far is a Nobel Prize for Potential and — no small thing — the wisdom to have
refrained from doing anything so wildly stupid as invading Iraq. The President has been willing to use military force -
the Predator drones that have decimated al-Qaeda's leadership testify to his lack of squeamishness — but this
Administration is supposed to be about the efficacy of using subtler expressions of.U.S. power. That doesn't happen
overnight, but for Obama's policies to be considered a success, it has to happen sooner or later, in a way that can be
explained to the public.
There is also a growing sense that the President's inexperience is beginning to show — not in his overall policy, which
represents the views of a broad, moderate national-security consensus ranging from Brent Scowcroft to John Kerry, but
in his execution of the details. The Afghan strategy review has been too public and taken too long; the Middle East peace
hunt has become a wild goose chase. A letter to Iran's Supreme Leader is a productive gesture only if it gets a response;
if it doesn't, it seems weak and supplicatory. A call for the Israelis to freeze settlements is effective only if it is
accompanied by the credible threat of a reduction in aid. ""You can't be seen pushing countries around — demanding
[that] Israel freeze settlements, demanding that Hamid Karzai reform his government — and not get results,"" says Leslie
H. Gelb, author of Power Rules. ""The leaders of these countries are tough, successful politicians, and they'll begin to take
you less seriously."" (See photos from the 1979 revolution in Iran.)
Clinton is unwilling to acknowledge these problems, and her staff is loath to admit her occasional mistakes. Her praise
for the President is fulsome, and aides say the relationship with Obama really — really — is strong. But there are also
burblings and emanations from Clinton's staff and friends, Foggy Bottom body language, that suggest there is a need for
the Administration to produce a second act after the Rodney King phase. And the White House is perplexed by the
uncharacteristic lack of discipline indicated by Clinton's occasional overseas gaffes.
These tensions are well within the boundaries of normal, creative policymaking. There is absolutely no indication that
the Secretary is frustrated to the point of jumping ship — or returning to politics as a candidate for governor of New
York, as has been rumored. Quite the contrary, she seems intent on making history as Secretary of State. To do that,
though, she will have to have the same authority at home as she has abroad. She will have to become the President's
primary foreign policy voice. Over the first nine months of the Obama Administration, seven different Obama officials
have spoken on the Sunday talk shows about foreign policy. Clinton has been on each of the Sunday shows once. ""Either
you have one person sending the foreign policy message, with the clear approval of the President,"" says a former
Republican Secretary of State, ""or there is no message.""(See photos from eight months of Obama's diplomacy.)
Aides to Obama say they would like to see her on the Sunday shows more often. (Indeed, Clinton's staff acknowledged
that she was asked to appear two additional times but was traveling and unable to do so.) Ultimately, though, television
is a metaphor for the larger questions that need to be resolved: How much can these former rivals — both extremely
guarded and private people — really trust each other; and, if not Clinton, who will emerge as the President's alter ego
on foreign policy? At this point, the strongest member of Obama's national-security team is Gates — but he's a
Republican and an unlikely spokesman or presidential confidant on anything beyond Pentagon issues. General Jim Jones
has settled in as National Security Adviser, but he's not a political animal — and every President needs a close foreign
policy adviser who understands the intersection of long-term strategy, politics and diplomatic chess.
Clinton's value to the Administration was clear in Pakistan. She wowed a public so skeptical that it had been questioning
the $7.5 billion in purely economic and humanitarian aid the Administration had promised. ""How much damage control
have you been able to do on this trip?"" asked Meher Bokhari, a television-news-show host, at the end of Clinton's
meeting with Pakistani women. The Secretary seemed nonplussed by the bluntness of the question. ""I don't know,"" she
said. ""I hope some.""
Afterward, I asked Bokhari to answer her own question. ""Well, this trip was long overdue,"" she said. ""The Pakistani
people really needed to talk to an American about our concerns — the strings attached to aid programs, the drone
attacks, their history of support for the military dictatorship. And it needs to be followed up. But if you ask me about the
damage control"" — she paused, thinking it through — ""I'd have to say a lot. She accomplished a lot.""

In the end, though, Clinton's success will be determined by whether she can expand her role beyond public diplomat.
She will have to become a more sure-handed negotiator and, most important, a trusted adviser to a President who
knows where he wants to go in the world but hasn't quite figured out how to get there.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
November 10, 2009
USGLC Applauds Choice of Dr. Rajiv Shah as USAID Administrator
In Choosing Dr. Shah, President Signals Important Role Development Plays in Foreign Policy
Washington, DC — The U.S. Global Leadership Coalition released the following statement from Executive
Director Liz Schrayer on President Obama's announcement of Dr. Rajiv Shah to be Administrator of the
U.S. Agency for International Development:
""The USGLC applauds the President's nomination of Dr. Rajiv Shah to be USAID Administrator as yet
another example of the President's commitment to elevating our civilian-led, smart power tools. With a
robust International Affairs Budget request for FY 2010, a pledge to double foreign assistance by 2015, a
Presidential Study Directive on Global Development and the State Department's Quadrennial Diplomacy
and Development Review, the Administration continues to demonstrate the essential role development and
diplomacy play in our foreign policy.
""Rajiv Shah is a fresh and dynamic addition to President Obama's foreign policy team. Dr. Shah will bring
expertise and energy to a critical agency in need of strong, empowered leadership. His career in global
development, global health and agricultural development give him real perspective to lead USAID. He is
already an important player in the Administration's food security initiative, and his additional background in
fighting global poverty and promoting global health make him an ideal candidate for this important post.
""The USGLC's broad, bipartisan coalition welcomes Dr. Shah's nomination to be USAID Administrator, and
we look forward to working with him to strengthen the role of development.""
The U.S. Global Leadership Coalition (www.usglc.org) is a broad-based influential network of 400
businesses and NGOs; national security and foreign policy experts; and business, faith-based, academic
and community leaders in all 50 states who support a smart power approach of elevating diplomacy and
development alongside defense in order to build a better, safer world.

See below.
I am looking at the article and don't know where this stands in terms of what will really happen (welcome an update) but
we should do some sort of meeting now with international gay groups to lay out what we have done.
The process will focus not only our public and quiet diplomacy (calls to pres, etc) efforts but also it will give chance for
feedback on more we should do.
I am worried this will not turn out well. We need some outreach unless I am missing what is being done in dept.
Can we do this in next several days?

Uganda to Drop Death Penalty, Life in Jail for Gays (Updatel)Last Updated: December 9, 2009 10:44 EST By Fred Ojambo
Dec. 9 (Bloomberg) -- Uganda will drop the death penalty and life imprisonment for gays in a refined version of an anti-
gay bill expected to be ready for presentation to Parliament in two weeks, James Nsaba Buturo, the minister of ethics
and integrity, said.The draft bill, which is under consideration by a parliamentary committee, will drop the two
punishments to attract the support of religious leaders who are opposed to these penalties, Buturo said today in a
phone interview from the capital, Kampala.Ugandan lawmaker David Bahati presented a private member's bill on Oct.
14 which sought the death penalty and life imprisonment for gay people in the country. The Ugandan government
supports the bill because homosexuality and lesbianism are ""repugnant to the Ugandan culture,"" Buturo said. Still, it
favors a more refined set of punishments, he said.ln addition to formulating punishments for the gay people, the bill will
also promote counseling to help ""attract errant people to acceptable sexual orientation,"" said Buturo.The proposed
legislation has attracted criticism from gay rights activists, both locally and internationally, who argue that the law would
promote discrimination and hatred toward the gay community.

deprivation among his men. He described a situation i n which guards habitualIy fa-,

There is also evidence that members of the guard force and their supervisn

mission for which they had never trained. AGNA :guards trig n for their mission r'
of the Embassy, not for reconnassance exercisesaway from the Embassy. This
the danger that gua-dscould have been drawn into a mil itay incident with or tai,
Tel i ban or Afghan locals, and created a vulnerability at the Embassy by removinc, ;
equipment, leaving the Embassy largely night-blind. AGNA management awarded
commendation to 18 pati ci pants trumpeting their ""Intrepidity"" in a document i
bearing the seal of the Department of State. (Attachment 5)
According to many guards, another situation in which Embassy security may hv
compromised is when, on at least one occasion, supervisors brought prostitutes in to C4
Sullivan. This is a breach of security and discipline made worse because the prostrti
escorted to the facility by some guard force supervisors themselves. Some intervievy,-..
that two AGNA guard force supervisors made no secret that, to celebrate a birthclew
brought prostitutes into Capp Sul I ival, which ma ntai ns a sign-in log. Women belt
prostitutes were observed attending the birthday party.
Is Protecting a U.S. Embassy in a Combat Zone an Inherently Governmental 1,'71/
Because the diplomatic mission i n Afghanistan is so critical , and becausr,,
in a combat zone, the need for effective Embassy security is particularly acute. JUG
the U.S. Naval Academy 2009 McCain Conference, there was a sent nar on ""Ethics
Contractors: Examining the Public-Private Partnership"" which looked at the question at
security in a combat zone is an inherently governmental function. According to the Ex en
Summary of the conference, "" contractors should not be deployed as security guards,
even prison guards within combat areas. [Armed Private Security Contractors] should b:
restricted to appropriate support functions and those geographic areas where therule (:)'
prevails. In irregular walae...environrnents, where civi Hai cooperation is crucial, I 1.

-Af
Sense of Congress that ""private security contractors are not authorized to perform ii~ her
governmental functions in an area of combat operations.""27 This language was
from legislation that.had passed the Senateactively prohibiting private security fr.;,
performing inherently governmental functions.28 In neither case, however, did thr.
I alguage recognize protecting a diplomatic mission in a combat zone as an i n1-4
governmental function. At the very least, this is a question that needs to be exami
the protection of the U.S, Embassy Kabul and other embassiesincombat zones.
The use of private contractors for security in a combat zone poses several di i en-,r-
is the inherent tension between the effective performance of a mission and the financi,--'
of' the contractor. Cutting costs is good for the bottoM line, but can put security at risk
case against AGNA brought by two former U.S. Embassy Kabul guard force supe-v,
Sauer aid Peter Martino, illustrates this problem. According to the complaint, AGNA.
""acknowledged that AGNA had underbid:the contract in order to secure it,"" and told
Mali no ""to make do' and put a `good face' on the situation to ensure that a profit wail.
made on the contract and that shareholders would be sati sfi ed....Defendants i mplernerm.,'
requiring more hours per i ndi Vi dual and fewer shifts of staff in order to cut costs a; '
Defendants' profit margin.""29 This is a dear exaTipleof the contractor endaigeim
diplomatic mission in order to advance its bottom line.
Another dilemma is the threat of work-stoppages—which, according to v.,
happened at least twice with the U.S. Embassy Kabul guard force. On two separaiE
the Gurkhas (who make up two-thirds of the guard force) threatened to walk off the ,
in one instance,, buses had arrived in order to take the Gurkhas to the Ei rport to returi i i.•
According to POGO sources, the time it took to resolve just one of those incidents

Yet another di I emma is that the laws i n place do not adequately hold accountabl
contractors who violate rules and endanger security i n combat zones. Unlike the mi I i tare
once had the responsibility of guarding embassies and which is bound by the Uniform C.,
M i I itary Justice, private employers such as security firms cannot ensure a binding chain
command that provides adequate discipline and professionalism i n the guard force

AGNA sought to maximize its profit by sacrificing the quality of protective vehi d es

chastised AGNA for the contractor's repeated fei I ures to fulfill staffing, I anguage
contract provisions. AGNA has also fa I ed to properly manage Carp Sullivan, ar.
detj I ed above.
The problems with AGNA' s U.S. Embassy Kabul security contract do not
unique for this contractor. Recently, an ArmorGroup security guard in Baghdad' s
al I egedl y shot and ki I led two fel I ow guards and wounded at I east one Iraqi . Extraordina

seriousconcerns about ArmorGroup' s vetting process, and adds to the bigger picturea; •
contractor in serious need of strict oversight.
Recommendations
1.After two yeas of fj I ed attempts by the Department of State to upgrade thepert,,;
its private security contractors in both Afghanistan and Iraq, the Department shot ;I(
arrangement with Defense Secretary Gates to provide i mmedi ate mil itary supervi'i,
private security force at the U.S. embassies in Kabul and Baghdad.
2.The State Department should promptly i niti ate a thorough and i ndependent i t w
U.S. Embassy Kabul security contract in order to hold corporations as wel I as i ndi
accountable for the above noted misconduct and contract violations. amply removing
people from contract management at AGNA or Wackenhut, or creating a new corporate ,-
compliance officer, is not going to ensure serious accountabi I ity. Al I owi ng thoserespon
quietly resign and seek work with other U.S. contractors, as guard force whist! eblowes
happening now, will only perpetuate this problem.
3.State Department representatives either knew or should have known about this1 oi ty
and dangerous situation regarding U.S. Embassy Kabul security. The StateDepartment
repeated warnings to AGNA were of no consequence, and Department officialsrasp-1r
oversight of this contract themselves should be held accountable.

By Krittivas Mukherjee and Pete Harrison
COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - China has told participants in the U.N. climate change talks that it sees no possibility of
achieving an operational accord this week, an official involved in the Copenhagen talks said on Thursday.
Dozens of heads of state are descending on the Danish capital to address the December 7-18 conference, and had hoped
to sign on Friday a new pact to tackle global warming.
The official, who asked not to be identified, told Reuters the Chinese had instead suggested issuing ""a short political
declaration of some sort,"" but it was not clear what that would say.
The official said negotiations were continuing to try to reach a breakthrough that would still allow an operational
agreement to be signed. The official said the sticking point for China appeared to be a process issue.
U.S. President Barack Obama has called for an ""operational accord"" -- essentially a political agreement with teeth that
can get countries working to cut or curb their greenhouse gas emissions while a more formal and binding treaty is
hammered out in 2010.
Some ministers warned that slow, often stalled talks during the summit meant it was staring at failure.
""We may not get there on the substance, it is quite possible we'll fail on the substance, but at least let's give it a try,""
said Britain's energy and climate minister Ed Miliband.
""At the moment the problem is we're not giving it a try.""
Developed and developing nations are at odds over who should cut emissions, how deep the cuts should be, and how
much funding should be provided to poor countries to help them shift to greener growth and adapt to a warmer world.
While the overall picture is bleak, there has been some progress in areas critical to reaching a deal.
Africa dramatically scaled back its expectations for climate aid from rich nations, and Japan pledged about $11 billion
(6.8 billion pound) in public funds to 2012 to help poor countries adapt to a warmer world and cut their emissions.
Talks on a U.N.-backed system to pay poorer nations to curb deforestation have advanced, and the United States
pledged $1 billion in short-term funds to conserve tropical forests.
A major sticking point between the world's top emitters, the United States and China, has been the question of how
they will prove they are sticking to emission-curbing plans.
On Tuesday, China's climate change ambassador warned developed countries against using climate change as an excuse
to set up trade barriers. Yu Qingtai said rich nations should not think that slapping carbon tariffs on imports from
countries with different emissions control regimes would substitute for reaching a global deal to tackle warming.","UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05766239 Date: 08/31/2015

Cheryl,
Rich and I met this morning with Chris Socha, Senator DeMint's foreign policy staffer. We took the
opportunity to discuss the nominations of Tom Shannon and Arturo Valenzuela. As you know, DeMint has
been very outspoken regarding Zelaya's ouster in Honduras.
With respect to Tom, it appears as though little has changed - DeMint still appears to be insisting on some
amount of floor debate followed by a roll call vote on the nomination. How much time and when is still
something that needs to be worked out. We've been following up on our end, but the DeMint camp has
slow walked things a bit. We expect to come to some agreement when the Senate reconvenes.
Arturo's nomination is in a different posture. As we approached the Senate's August recess, there
appeared to be some loosening of DeMint's hold on him. After speaking with DeMint's staff, we're still
hopeful that we could get Arturo confirmed by either voice vote or by unanimous consent when the Senate
returns. However, Chris warned that DeMint is monitoring closely the Administration's position
with regards to sanctions. He warned that if a coup determination is made and new sanctions
levied, this could very well have an adverse impact on how Arturo's nomination moves forward.
We wanted to alert you to this latter point because we understand a determination from L
could be coming down shortly.
DeMint's staffer explained that the Senator would welcome a call from either S or Deputy Steinberg, and
he thought a call could go a long way to freeing up Arturo's nomination. We're preparing a call sheet for
Deputy Steinberg.
Thanks.

Suzanne and I had a very construtive and frank discussion with Richard Goldstone this morning.
We will provide you with added details later but as general background for you, we did outline our concerns about the
report to him and our concerns about the UN process. We also talked about next steps, focused on moving away from
the UN and more toward appropriate responses by each of the parties.

Re Blackwater. I have already put these very questions to our team, and they are working up a memo on the subject.
Significantly, the press accounts are all saying that State Department lawyers appropriately warned the DalprosecUtors,
but that the DO1 lawyers chose to take a different route.

Associated Press Writer
SCRANTON, Pa. (AP) - The nation's foreign exchange student programs need better federal oversight, the State
Department's internal watchdog concludes in a new report following a scandal in which students were placed in
shoddy homes in Pennsylvania.
Acting Inspector General Harold Geisel said in the report, released this week, the department's Bureau of
Educational and Cultural Affairs has largely abdicated its responsibility to ensure the well-being of thousands of
exchange students who come to the United States each year.
Instead, the sponsoring organizations themselves have been left to monitor their own programs and self-report
problems to federal regulators, the report said.
'There are insufficient dedicated resources at ECA to conduct effective oversight of youth exchange programs,"" the
report said.
The inspector general began its review in July, following allegations that an employee of a San Francisco-based
exchange program placed students in filthy homes around Scranton in northeastern Pennsylvania. Edna Burgette
was fired from Aspect Foundation after being charged in July with five felony counts of criminal negligence.
Aspect said it deplored Burgette's actions and had no prior knowledge of the neglect, but the agency was penalized
by the State Department.
""We're absolutely committed to strengthening our programs, making them the best they can be and ensuring that all
students have safe and rewarding experiences,"" Maura Pally, acting assistant secretary of state for educational and
cultural affairs, told The Associated Press on Friday.
In the wake of the Scranton case, the bureau added staff, established a separate unit to conduct site visits, e-mailed
current students to inquire about how their experiences are going, and set up a database to track problems, among
other fixes meant to improve oversight.
Also, proposed federal regulations would tighten requirements for host families and set up more rigorous
background checks.
""We acknowledge there were serious problems with our monitoring and oversight, and we agree with the IG's
assessment that things needed to change,"" Pally said. ""The way things were operating was just not acceptable, and
we began making changes even before the report was released.""

Report calls for more oversight of student exchange
programs
• STORY HIGHLIGHTS
• Inspector general's report cites programs receiving State Department grants
• Report calls for stronger monitoring of youth placement groups
• Report comes after some foreign students complained of neglect,. abuse
• Report: Establish requirements for criminal history checks of host families
WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Youth exchange programs receiving U.S. State Department grants are suffering from.
insufficient oversight and attention from the federal government, according to an inspector general's report
released Thursday.
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05766568 Date: 07/31/2015

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05766568 Date: 07/31/2015
An inspector general's report calls for more oversight of student exchange programs.
The report calls for stronger monitoring of youth placement groups that receive federal grants to sponsor
exchange students. It finds that the department has been ""relying instead on the coordinator to self-monitor.""
Participants in the exchange programs are typically 15 to 18 and are among ""the most vulnerable,"" according
to the report.
In 2008, the State Department gave 17 such, groups $39.4 million in taxpayer funds to manage programs
involving exchange students.
One of those groups, Aspect Foundation, received $1.08 million of those funds. However, Aspect came under
fire this year after students from Europe, Africa and South America -- whom the California-based foundation
had placed in Scranton, Pennsylvania -- came forward with allegations of mistreatment and abandonment.
CNN aired a detailed report on the case in July, after which the State Department said it would set up a toll-
free telephone number that foreign exchange students could use to report problems and tighten its oversight of
government-funded exchange student programs.
The inspector general's report notes that previous audits of the State Department's Bureau of Educational and
Cultural Affairs (ECA), which also found deficiencies in program oversight, found the department slow to make
changes.
""The incidents in Northeastern Pennsylvania were allowed to happen, in part, because of a lack of clear
regulations that allowed sponsor organizations to interpret the rules in a manner that ultimately endangered
these students,"" said Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pennsylvania, on Thursday.
In May, Casey pushed for an investigation into the Department of State's oversight of youth exchange
programs following reports out of Scranton.
One student was placed in a Scranton home with a person who had been convicted of a drug-related felony,
Lackawanna County, Pennsylvania, District Attorney Andrew Jarbola has told CNN. Some students were so
malnourished that one was treated in a hospital for dehydration; another was put up in a home that was later
condemned by the city, he said.
The families that housed the students say the allegations are untrue. The Aspect Foundation first denied any
problems existed, then said it had corrected them and fired those responsible.
The State Department sanctioned Aspect by reducing the number of students it can bring over for the 2010-
2011 school year, a penalty that amounted to a loss of revenue of about $540,000, according to the
department.
""We at the Department of State recognize [because we] are responsible for this program we have to make
sure we are aggressively overseeing this program and make sure children are well-suited,"" said State
Department spokesman P.J. Crowley at the time.

The inspector general's report released Thursday does not specifically mention Aspect. It does review four
State Department programs, including Youth Exchange Study (YES) and the Future Leaders Exchange
(FLEX), both of which have given grants to the foundation.
The report calls on the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs, which oversees the grant programs, to
establish requirements for criminal history checks of host families and put more resources into site visits at
placement groups.
""The Department of State has taken action to rectify its failure in the oversight and monitoring of exchange
programs,"" Casey said. ""However, the real measure of progress will be what specific steps are taken to
prevent this problem from happening again.""

Dear Cheryl,
I want you to know that last month a friend of mine convinced me to apply for a fellowship at Harvard/Institute of
Politics, and I did. A few days ago, I got a call from the Program Director who informed me that I was accepted. I am very
excited about it and think it will be a very good opportunity to share my experience with students who
are learning theories about democracy and development.
Cheryl, I am going to be bold and ask you if you would accept my invitation to come and speak to the students while I
am there. I am asked and encouraged to invite important personalities who can talk of their experience in government
and I thought of you. I would be thrilled if you accept. I will be there from end of January until the beginning of May next
year. I have also invited President Moreno of IDB who accepted and I am waiting for an answer from Michaelle Jean, the
General Governor of Canada.
I wish you the very best, to you and your family for Christmas and the New Year. I hope our roads cross again as we
thrive to better the lives of so many people who deserve it. Please extend my wished to the Secretary of State. I admire
her and her work.
Warm regards,
Michele
Michele Duvivier Pierre-Louis

Re: Update on Blair/EU presidency
Jonathan Powell just called to relay the following: He says the Blair EU candidacy is far from
dead, though a 40-60 proposition now. Powell has spoken with Sarkozy, who remains
supportive. The Socialists damaged Blair because they don't want a strong president and floated
the Miliband as EU foreign secretary story in order to undermine Tony further. Powell (and
Tony) appreciates Bill's willingness to write an op-ed, but understands why it couldn't be
published. Merkel remains the key. Having been for Tony, she is now neutral, but still favorably
inclined and doesn't know what to do. A nonentity as president would not appeal to her. Your
conversation with her remains important.

IP 23: BACKGROUND ON FORUM FOR THE FUTURE
From an idea of partnership to a growing reality, the Broader Middle East
and North Africa (BMENA) Initiative represents genuine cooperation
between the G8 and European nations and the governments, business, and
civil society of the region to expand opportunities and prosperity for all.
• The leaders of the G8 industrialized nations and BMENA countries
launched the Partnership for Progress and a Common Future — a blueprint
for how G8 and Middle Eastern countries could best work together to
support indigenous calls for reform — at the G8 Sea Island, Georgia,
summit in June 2004.
• The centerpiece of BMENA is the Forum for the Future, an annual
gathering of G8, European, and BMENA Foreign Ministers with civil
society to discuss and advance the reform agenda.
• The Forum for the Future provides a unique venue for BMENA civil
society organizations to meet with their government ministers as equal
participants. The Forum fosters constructive government-civil society
interaction to solve complex political, economic, and social problems of
participating countries.
• This year's Forum will include approximately 40 civil society
representatives who participate directly alongside governments. Civil
society participation in the Forum has risen considerably every year since
the first Forum in Morocco in 2004, when only five leaders participated.
• Foreign ministers from across the BMENA region, the G8, and other
partner countries now work with these organizations to further progress
and development in the areas of good governance, civil society,
economic prosperity, and education.
• This year, civil society organizations coordinated three preparatory
meetings involving governments of the region with a cross-section of
civil society leaders to outline priorities and develop recommendations
for the Forum ministerial.

US Responds To Sri Lanka Protest Over Clinton Remark (AFP) Monday, October 5, 2009 AFP
WASHINGTON (AFP) - The United States, responding to protests from Sri Lanka over remarks by Secretary of State Hillary
Clinton, said it had no recent evidence of women being raped while in Sri Lankan government custody.
In a letter addressed to Sri Lanka's Minister of Foreign Affairs Rohitha Bogollagama, the State Department noted that the
US government and international human rights groups over the years had detailed ""numerous cases of rape and sexual
violence in Sri Lanka, particularly acts committed against women held in detention by the government.""
However, the letter signed by Melanne Verveer, ambassador at large for global women's issues at the State Department
said that ""in the most recent phase of the conflict, from 2006 to 2009 ... we have not received reports that rape and
sexual abuse were used as tools of war, as they clearly have in other conflict area around the world.""
""We hope that this clarification puts the issue in its proper context,"" the letter said, adding that Washington remains
concerned about extrajudicial killings, disappearances and detainee abuse in Sri Lanka.
""Secretary Clinton believes that Sri Lanka must focus to the future and move forward on the promotion of peace and the
protection of human rights,"" the letter said.
Sri Lanka lodged its protest with the US embassy in Colombo over the remarks made by Clinton last month to the United
Nations Security Council.
""We've seen rape used as a tactic of war before in Bosnia, Burma and Sri Lanka and elsewhere,"" the US secretary of state
had said during a resolution calling for an end to sexual violence in armed conflict, according to published reports of
Clinton's remarks.
Her comments sparked an outcry across Sri Lanka, where government forces in May crushed Tamil Tiger rebels after
decades of fighting.
Colombo faced condemnation for its handling of the final stages of the war against Tiger rebels and managed to stave
off a Security Council resolution calling for war crimes investigations thanks to the vetoes of China and Russia.
The United Nations has said that over 7,000 civilians perished in the first four months of intense fighting this year.
Sri Lanka is now facing international pressure to free 250,000 ethnic Tamil civilians who managed to escape the fighting
but are now held in internment camps while they are screened to see whether they were rebels.

talks
White House spurned five requests from PM's aides for bilateral meeting

London in April 2009. Photograph: Jason Reed/Reufers
Gordon Brown lurched from being hailed as a global statesman to intense embarrassment tonight, after it
emerged US President Barack Obama had turned down no fewer than five requests from Downing Street to
hold a bilateral meeting at the United Na tions in New York or at the G20 summit starting in Pittsburgh today.
The prime minister, eager to portray himself as a leading player on the international stage in America this week,
was also forced to play down suggestions from inside his own party that he might step down early, either due to
ill health or deteriorating eyesight.
There have been tensions between the White House and No 10 for weeks over Brown's handling of the Scottish
government's decision to release the man convicted of the Lockerbie bombing, Abdelbaset al-Megrahi.
Brown's efforts to secure a prestigious primetime slot for his keynote speech at the general assembly in New
York were also thwarted when the Libyan leader, Colonel Gaddafi, delivered a 100-minute speech to the UN,
massively running over Brown's 15 minute slot.
Brown had not only been seeking a bilateral meeting with Obama, but feelers were also sent out to hold a joint
press conference, an event that would have boosted Brown's efforts to offer himself as a linchpin of
international diplomacy. Government sources said that Britain even changed its policy on swine flu
immunisation in Africa to match that of the Obama administration last week, in an attempt to rebuild relations.
No 10 denied there had been any hint of a snub, saying Obama and Brown had plenty of chances to talk as they
sat next to one another at the summits. They insisted they were working closely on issues such as future
economic regulation, bankers' bonuses, nuclear non-proliferation and climate change. Brown himself insisted: ""I
do say that the special relationship is strong, it continues to strengthen.""
But Obama has held bilateral meetings in New York with the Chinese president, Hu Jintao, the Russian
president, Dmitry Medvedev, and the new Japanese prime minister, Yukio Hatoyama.
News of the five spurned approaches compounded a miserable day for Brown at home which saw a
parliamentary aide resign over the prime minister's refusal to sack Lady Scotland, the attorney general, after she
was fined £5,000 for employing an illegal immigrant, as well as a withering attack by the former home secretary
Charles Clarke.
Stephen Hesford, Labour MP for Wirral West, told Brown in a resignation letter: ""In my view, the facts of the
case do not matter. It is the principle which counts, particularly at a time when the public's trust of Whitehall is
uncertain to say the least. We have to be seen to be accountable.""
Brown was also savaged by Charles Clarke, who told the Evening Standard that in his view Brown's leadership
risked letting ""the whole Labour ship crash on to the rocks of May 2010 [the expected date of the general
election] and sink for a very long time"". He said he hoped rumours that Brown would quit would come true. ""I
think his own dignity ought to look to that kind of solution.""
In two interviews , Brown was forced for the first time to field questions about his health. ""My sight is not at all
deteriorating,"" he told NBC.
Asked on BBC Radio 5 Live whether he might quit for health reasons, the prime minister replied: ""I am healthy
and I am very fit. I run a lot to keep fit and I will continue to keep fit.
""I keep going. I have got a job to do. I have got work to do. We have got to meet this challenge.""
In his own speech to the UN, Obama promised an end to the unilateralism marked by the previous Bush
administration, an approach that saw US and Britain working in tandem. In remarks that suggest Obama will
focus on broadening American alliances across the globe, he said: ""The time has come for the world to move in
a new direction ... a new era of engagement based on mutual interest and mutual respect.""
Last week, the White House had unusually briefed that Obama had told B rown in a phone conversation that he
disapproved of the release of the Lockerbie bomber on compassionate grounds, something No 10 had not
highlighted. Megrahi was released on the basis that he had three months to live, and then received a hero's
welcome as he returned to Tripoli.
Brown had said he respected the release, but insisted undertakings by the Libyans that the return would be low-
key had been broken.
In an attempt to distance himself from the Libyans, Brown moved to toughen his position against Colonel
Gaddafi after Libya's leader theatrically tore up the UN charter in his address. Gaddafi said the security council
should be renamed ""the terror council"".
Brown countered in his speech in New York later: ""I am here to reaffirm the UN charter, not to tear it up. I call
on everyone to support its universal principles.""
He urged world leaders to recognise that the next six months presented tests on climate change and terrorism
that were as huge as the banking crisis. On climate change he said: ""If we miss this opportunity to protect our
planet, we cannot hope for a second chance some time in the future. There will be no retrospective global
agreement to undo the damage we have caused. This is the moment now to limit and reverse climate change we
are inflicting on future generations.""
He added: ""If the poorest and most vulnerable are going to be able to adapt, if the emerging economies are
going to embark on low-carbon development paths, if the forest nations are going to slow and stop
deforestation, then the richer countries must contribute financially.""
No 10 again denied that the prime minister had been snubbed last night. A spokesman said the stories were
""without foundation. As we have said throughout the week, the prime minister and President Obama are having
a number of meetings throughout the week. These included a wide-ranging discussion following last night's
climate change dinner. They will also be co-chairing an important meeting on Thursday on Pakistan and the
fight against terrorism. As the prime minister has already said, there will be further meetings at the G20 summit
in Pittsburgh.""","UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05764892 Date: 07/31/2015

Cheryl, Meghann,
Below is some intel David got on the Mexico conference David picked up from the Mexicans here. The conference's
timing would be extremely awkward if things proceed as Guy Noel suggests:
Guy reports that ""they"" have decided to go forward with:
1)October 29th Interpellation (Impeachment) of the PM
2) Oct. 31St the president will add the ratification of the new PM on the existing list of the LOWER HOUSE activities
(which Guy asserts is illegal)
3) November 3rd Nomination of the new PM
4) Then the ratification of the PM
You can bet that the PM will repeat all this verbatim to George Soros when she sees him today. Not sure what - if
anything - that will provoke.
got this information too and has a pre-scheduled meeting with Preval today. I understand he plans on
raising this. We'll let you know what we hear.
In my Tuesday lunch with Gabriel I mentioned in very clear terms our concern about any sort of turmoil in government
reflecting very badly on the international community's efforts to tout Haiti as stable and open for investment. He said
he understood. He said, ""I don't see Michelle (Pierre-Louis) going anywhere soon."" He conceded that while Preval did
have a majority in Parliament, he could not control all parliamentarians on all issues.
We'll try and get in to see someone from the Senate in the coming days.
This is why a call would be most useful.

international community's engagement with Haiti (both political and assistance), but that it has morphed into a donor's
meeting to discuss coordination of assistance. Originally they planned to invite Foreign Ministers, but now they are
inviting the heads of assistance agencies. Preval was originally to attend, but he has decided to send his Foreign
Minister and the Minister of Planning. Romero indicated that the GOM has not received the number and caliber of
confirmations of attendance that they had hoped for. I asked Romero what outcome the GOM would like to see from
the meeting, and he said that they want to encourage donors to coordinate more with the GOH and among themselves.
The GOM hosted an ""experts"" meeting on Haiti two weeks ago where a number of individuals long involved in Haiti
presented position papers on the political, economic and assistance challenges in Haiti. He said that a common theme
of the papers was the need for greater donor coordination. He will send me a set of the position papers. Mexico is not a
donor to Haiti.

Cheryl,
As you know, is serving as a public delegate to UNGA. I don't have details, but we have just
learned that son died this weekend. We do not know more than that and so far, there is nothing in the
press about it. I thought you and the Secretary would want know about this. Will update you if I learn more.

Department of State Ranks High as Employer for HBCU Students and
Alumni
Washington, DC
October 26, 2009
In the current edition of HBCU Connect, the Department of State placed among the top five employers for Historically Black
Colleges and University (HBCU) students and alumni. The Department of State is the highest-ranking Federal agency, listed
under first-ranked McGraw-Hill, second-ranked Continuum Health Partners, and third-ranked State Farm.
HBCU Connect's ranking of best employers is based on the following criteria: HBCU student and alumni recruitment, brand
penetration in HBCU communities, relationship with HBCU organizations, consistency in outreach efforts, types of positions
made available, and messaging used to reach audience.
It is worth noting that the Department of State ranked:
• first as best federal employer for HBCU students and alumni
• fourth as best employer for HBCU students and alumni

Subject: Thanks
I appreciate being included in the dialogue last evening. I now have a much better appreciation for the challenges, as
well as the pressures you and the Secretary address each day. While I suspect there is not much that those of us on the
""outside"" can do to help, call on me at any time if I can assist in any fashion. Not to be too dramatic about it but the
Secretary's success is in the country's interests. Reference was made last night to more rest for HRC-I have to believe
that with the rigors of your job a little R+R for you is in order-hopefully you can work out some personal time over the
holiday period.
By the way, can you give me an email for Capricia Marshall?
All the best and do call if there is anything I can do.

ARNAUD DE BORCHGRAVE
UPI Editor at Large
WASHINGTON, Nov. 4 (UPI) -- If we are successful beyond President Obama's wildest dreams -- e.g., the
Taliban is wiped out and a tough new Afghan government does not allow al-Qaida or other terrorists to conspire
against us on their territory -- would that make us safer from radical Islam? The answer, of course, is no,
because this is riot about geography. Two veteran intelligence operatives with much Middle Eastern and Afghan
experience, speaking not for attribution, agreed a stable, secure Afghanistan doesn't change the equation, at least
not significantly.
The popular perception of al-Qaida in Afghanistan is the same propaganda news clip, shown a gazillion times
over the last eight years, replete with terrorist ""trainees"" in shalwar-kameez (knee-length shirts over baggy
pantaloons) running through obstacle courses and emerging from tunnels, presumably to kill us all in our beds.
Al-Qaida doesn't need commando-steeled volunteers to attack the United States and its allies. For the next Sept.
11, the chances are they have already selected highly motivated, brainwashed wackjobs among the graduates of
Pakistan's madrassas, who look forward to a one button push to the land of plenty in the sky where 72 impatient
maidens await their arrival. Al-Qaida's ""martyrs"" don't need Afghan training camps for WMD terrorism. In fact,
to be inconspicuous, they should not have the physique of an avoid-at-all-cost likely to arouse suspicion.
Al-Qaida does not need Afghanistan for its next terrorist objective. In fact, those who follow events in
Afghanistan closely were taken aback when Obama said Afghanistan was a war of necessity because that's
where al-Qaida. is. They haven't been there since Afghanistan was liberated in October 2001. They moved to
Pakistan's tribal areas where they attracted volunteers from the Middle East and Europe. When a reconstituted
Taliban insurgent force re-entered Afghanistan in large numbers in 2004, al-Qaida was not interested in its now
insecure old training camps. Even if Pakistan's current offensive.against the Taliban and al-Qaida in the tribal
areas is successful, al-Qaida is not an entity that can be captured or destroyed. Its clandestine operatives are
widely scattered in the Middle East, Africa, Europe, North and South America.
As alternatives to Afghanistan and Pakistan, Yemen, in the vernacular of the intelligence community, will do/is
doing it. Somalia will do/is doing it. West African states whose writ doesn't extend much beyond their capitals
will do/are doing it. Grimy North African suburbs of major French cities will do/are doing it. British provincial
towns with Pakistani enclaves will do/are doing it. And the Internet's thousands of pro-al-Qaida Web sites will
do/are doing it.
Osama bin Laden and his deputy Ayman al-Zawahiri are believed to be comfortably installed in a tribal chiefs
compound somewhere near Quetta, the capital of Pakistan's constantly rebellious Baluchistan province, which
has 48 percent of the country's land with. only 10 million of its 175 million people. There is no al-Qaida central
issuing orders to thousands of adherents the world over.
If the:re is no connection between Afghanistan and the core problem of ""no more Sept. lls,"" what are the United
States and 41 friendly nations doing there? Even in the event of a Taliban victory in the years to come, the
Taliban would not be stupid enough to invite al-Qaida back. Three months prior to Sept. 11, 2001, there was
palpable tension between Taliban leader Mullah Omar and bin Laden. Omar complained that bin Laden was
issuing ""too many fatwas (religious edicts) which he has no business doing as he didn't complete his religious
education."" Omar also prevented journalists from seeing bin Laden. The Taliban leader knows he lost power
and his country because of what bin Laden and his terrorists did to the United States.
In today's Afghanistan almost everything turns out to be corruption and mismanagement. The average citizen
has seen little benefit from expenditures in the $250 billion range -- on top of $1 trillion in Iraq. The .U.S. effort
has been plagued by fraud, laced with mismanagement and bereft of strategic focus. One example among many
others came in 2007 when the United States awarded a massive contract worth some $300 million to A:EY, a
Florida-based company, to supply the Afghan army with 52 types of ammo, chiefly bullets for AK-47s. All
requirements for safety inspections, mandatory for all ammo delivered to U.S. forces, were removed. Thus AEY
was able to shop around in Eastern Europe for the cheapest ammo available. Millions of rounds of old Chinese
ammo made in the 1960s turned out to be substandard. and dangerous.
The State Department was aware of what was going on but did not object as speed was the only criterion. AEY
and its officers were eventually indicted in Florida. But U.S. officials involved got off with a slap on the wrist.
Wherever U.S. inspectors look, they find fraud and abuse. There are even cases -- reported by GlobalPost
reporter Jean Mackenzie -- of American contractors paying bribes to the Taliban to ensure aid projects are not
disrupted. This is a recipe for a war without end. She also reports a disguised Taliban office in Kabul that
reviews all aid projects and determines the amount to be paid to the Taliban.
If true, the United States is paying the Afghan government to fight the Taliban while also paying the Taliban to
fight the Afghan government.
The key lies in Pakistan. Almost all terrorist trails in Europe lead back to Pakistan -- and its madrassas. These
are the free Koranic schools that have stepped into the vacuum of no education system for the poor as the
military takes up 50 percent of government revenue. A fraction of what the United States has spent in Iraq and
Afghanistan would go a long way to turning Pakistan around. Instead, Congress, in its infinite wisdom, after
authorizing $1.2 trillion in both wars allocated $7.5 billion to Pakistan over five years -- with umpteen caveats.
In a country of 175 million, a drop in the proverbial bucket.","UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05765160 Date: 07/31/2015
