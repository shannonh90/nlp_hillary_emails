Most interesting observation of the day, from
""A statistical analysis of the data issued by the ministry of interior suggests a perfect linear relationship between votes
received by Ahmadinejad and Mousavi with an r-squared value of 0.9995, a near impossibility in nature.This suggests
that the ballots were never counted or were abandoned after it was clear Ahmadinejad was going to lose. Statistically, it
is impossible to maintain such a perfect linear relationship consistently through all stages of vote counting. We would
expect variation as the votes were coming in, due to differences expected between the cites and the country side and
hetereogeneity amoung ethnic groups.This to me is the most concrete evidence I have seen""

• ARKADELPHIA — Johnnie Mae Walker Spargo was born on the first day of Spring, March 20, 1919, and from that
day until her last on this earth, Nov. 8, 2009, she cast her beautiful blue eyes and dimpled smile on all of those around
her.
Johnnie Mae was the youngest daughter of Garland Lee and Nettie Mann Walker of Red Oak, Arkansas, now part of Hot
Springs on the southeast shores of Lake Hamilton. She was predeceased by her parents and siblings, Claude, Eddie,
Grady, Hansel, Clara, Isli, and Doyle. She was predeceased by her loving husband of 67 years, Stephen Fowler Spargo,
and by Jamie and Billy Gibbs, her daughter and sonin-law, and her son-in-law Allen Brown DeLamar. The Spargos, natives
of Hot Springs, made Arkadelphia home when Steve joined Reynolds Aluminum Company in 1954.
Mrs. Spargo is survived by her son and daughter-in-law, Byron and Mary Lynda Spargo, of Baton Rouge, La., and her
daughters, Nancy Spargo DeLamar, of Little Rock, and Dr. Linda Spargo, of Oxford, Miss. Her grandchildren include
Megan DeLamar Schroeder and her husband, Trey, of Texarkana; Hattie Alton of Oxford, Miss.; Johni Beth Gibbs and her
fiance Jeremy Teague of Sheridan; Gwendy Clingman and her husband, Ed, of Mechanicsville, Va.; and Leslie Spargo of
Baton Rouge. Johnnie Mae was especially proud of her great-grandchildren: Frances and Eleanor Schroeder and Ryan
and Lauren Clingman.
She was a fierce and loyal advocate for each and every one of her offspring and truly believed that they could be
anything in the world they wanted to be. She was a member of the First Methodist Church in Arkadelphia. Johnnie Mae
was a pre-school teacher for many years at Margo Nelson's Wonderland School in Arkadelphia. She also helped her
community as a constant and reliable election poll worker. Even though Johnnie Mae was determined that she not be
perceived as a retiring little granny, her family was her universe. She was a strong, vibrant woman with black hair coiffed
on top of her head and clicking high heels, and she had beautiful skin that all of her progeny hope to inherit. She
believed in living to the fullest until the end, doing good works, helping all whom she encountered in ways that she
could, and imbuing her children and grandchildren with a strong work ethic and deep empathy for those less fortunate.
Many people in Arkansas have been the recipient of one of her lemon butter pound cakes for doing something kind for
one of her girls. When she won the 2003 Clark County Democrat of the Year, Johnnie Mae was described as a cross
between Eva Peron and Mary Poppins.
Johnnie Mae made her mark on Arkadelphia, determined that her children would enjoy to the fullest the experiences
that the Norman Rockwellian setting provided. She threw herself into any endeavor that her children and grandchildren
wanted to pursue. When Becky Fuller, now Rebecca Ward, was the first person from the city to win a statewide election
at Girl's State, Johnnie Mae organized a city-wide homecoming celebration complete with a parade for all the
Arkadelphia delegates that included her daughter Nancy. When Johnnie Mae's daughter Jamie wanted to pursue rodeo
and barrel racing, Nonnie perfected her ability to sew cowgirl outfits while also cheering-on her daughter from the
stands. When her daughter Linda wanted to serve as a cheerleader for Arkadelphia High School and then Ouachita
Baptist University, Johnnie Mae and Steve's house became nerve-center for all events athletic. When daughter Nancy
returned to Arkadelphia in 1964 with seven-month-old Megan to raise, Johnnie and Steve provided a nurturing, loving
home for daughter and granddaughter. Megan was the grandchild who gave Johnnie Mae her proudest title: Johnnie
Mae became ""Nonnie.""
Nonnie was queen of a tribe of three generations of women known as ""Spargo Girls."" When her great-granddaughters
Frances and Eleanor were born in 1999, Nonnie was determined that the twin girls would not use an exclusive
communication method. Nonnie's special task was to talk with them extensively and one-on-one, making sure that the

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05760369 Date: 06/30/2015
girls' first desire was to talk to her. Active in Democratic politics at all levels and with a passion, she was equally a
dedicated life master of duplicate bridge and played many a set with her friends at the House of Bridge in Hot Springs.
Johnnie ultimately spent most of her time driving to wherever one of her children lived to help with whatever tasks of
life needed tending. In response to this demanding schedule, she famously responded, ""You can sleep when you are
dead!"" Her stock question when confronted with news from one of her children of a pending event — whether one was
receiving an award or going out for lunch — was ""Well, what will you wear?"" Raising all these Spargo girls, she was
expert not only at re-upholstering an entire set of living room furniture, she also sewed countless, spontaneous-yet-
appropriate attire, from couture evening gowns to cowgirl wear. Making ball gowns from the draperies was not
exclusive to other southern heroines.
Perhaps Johnnie Mae's most endearing qualities were unfailing optimism combined with great pragmatism. She lived in
the present and did not believe in guilt or regrets. Born before women could vote, she cast one of her last votes for the
woman she hoped would be the first woman President. When Hillary did not prevail, she once again enjoyed casting a
vote for a straight Democratic ticket. Nonnie would want the family to express special gratitude for the many kindnesses
extended to her by the staff and nurses at Presbyterian Village in Little Rock, where she resided since June 2009. Thank
you is extended also to Arkansas Hospice whose compassion and care comforted both family and friends. Thanks are
also expressed to the staff of Home Instead and their compassionate caregiver, Bette White. John Lee Roberts of
Arkadelphia provided unwavering help and assistance and was a much loved friend and companion to both Steve and
Johnnie Mae.
The family will have a visitation at 9:30-10:30 a.m. Wednesday at Ruggles-Wilcox Funeral Home in Arkadelphia, followed
by a graveside service at 10:30 a.m. Wednesday at Rose Hill Cemetery led by Father Douglas Anderson of St. James
Episcopal Church, Texarkana. Memorials may be made to Arkansas Hospice, 5600 W 12th St., Little Rock, Ark. 72204;

SUBJECT: Libya (37)
SOURCE: Sources with direct access to the Libyan National Transitional
Council, as well as the highest levels of European Governments, and Western
Intelligence and security services.
THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION COMES FROM AN EXTREMELY
SENSITIVE SOURCE AND SHOULD BE HANDLED WITH CARE.
1. On September 12, 2012 Libyan President Mohammed Yussef el Magariaf
told senior advisors that the death of the U.S. Ambassador at the hands of Islamist
militia forces represents a threat to the future of the newly elected General National
Congress (GNC) Government. According to a sensitive source, el Magariaf
believes that the primary goal of this and other attacks on Western facilities is to
demonstrate that the GNC cannot protect its non-Islamic friends. Libyan security
officials believe that the attack was carried out by forces of the Islamist militia
group calling itself the Ansar al Sharia brigade; working out of camps in the
Eastern suburbs of Benghazi. These officials added that their sources indicate that
this group is led by former members of the old Libyan Islamic Fighting Group
(LIFG), some of whom are loyal to Islamist General Abdelhaldm Belhaj. The
same officials were quick to point out that they have no evidence that Belhaj had
any direct involvement in this attack. They also have no direct information as to
whether this assault has anything to do with the death of Libyan born al Qarda
leader Abu Yahya al- Libi, but they are pursuing this theme. These officials do

believe that the attackers having prepared to launch their assault took advantage of
the cover provided by the demonstrations in Benghazi protesting an internet
production seen as disrespectful to the prophet Mohammed.
2 According to this source, the immediate events were set in motion by a
statement made by a Muslim Cleric in Egypt saying that the intemet film was
going to be shown across the United States on September 11 in an effort to insult
Muslims on the anniversary of the attacks on the New York World Trade Center in
2001. This statement inspired increasingly hostile demonstrations at the U.S.
Embassy in Cairo, and at diplomatic facilities in Libya. In Benghazi, reporting
from security sources states, approximately twenty one (21) Ansar al Sharia
fighters left their base in East Benghazi just after sundown infiltrated the crowd of
about 2,000 demonstrators at the U.S. Consulate. These forces, operating under
cover of darkness, opened fire on the consulate, eventually setting it on fire with
rocket propelled grenades. These fighters then withdrew to their camp. El
Magariaf ordered security officials to identify and arrest the attackers, adding that
he had been in touch with Egyptian President Mohmmed Morsi, and the two
agreed that their intelligence and security personnel will cooperate in this matter.
(Note: Some of the Libyan officials believe that the entire demonstration was
organized as cover for the attack, however; they point out that there is no evidence
of such a complex operation at this time.
3. (Source Comment: In the opinion of this individual, Libyan security
officers also informed el Magariaf that the attacks had been planned for
approximately one month, based on casing information obtained during an early
demonstration at the U.S. consulate in Benghazi. The attackers were, in the
opinion of these individuals, looking for an opportunity to approach the consulate

under cover in a crowd. These officials add that government security officers
admitted to el Magariaf that they do not have the physical capacity to locate,
attack, and destroy the Ansar al-Sharia brigade, among others. They describe these
forces as well-trained, hardened killers; many of whom have spent time in
Afghanistan and Yemen. These fighters are located in camps in Eastern Libya; and
Libyan officials doubt they can penetrate these camps because the militia's are
better armed than the forces of the new National Army.
4. In the opinion of a separate source El Magariaf continues to believe that
the attacks were planned and carried out in a political atmosphere where a portion
of the Libyan population is focused on past cooperation between Western
intelligence and security services, and the regime of former dictator Muammar al
Qadclafi. According to this source, el Magariaf realizes that the death of the U.S.
Ambassador dictates that he must find tangible solutions to the problems tied to
disarming the militias, dealing Salafist violence against the followers of Sufi
beliefs, and efforts to discredit his government through linking him to Western
intelligence services. El Magariaf instructed his security officials to cooperate
with their U.S. counterparts. He also warned all of his advisors to be prepared for
U.S. retaliation against the suspected perpetrators of this attack, and the angry
public reaction that is sure to follow.
5. (Source comment: A separate, particularly sensitive source added that in
private conversation el Magariaf stated that if his government cannot protect a
senior diplomatic official, foreign businesses will not be willing to risk opening up
new operations in Libya. According to this sensitive source, el Magariaf believes
that a number of the Islamist militias are now being influenced al Qarcla and other
radical groups; working out of camps in the Eastern and Southeastern parts of the

country. These groups are receiving aid and weapons from supporters in Sudan.
In the end, el Magariaf added that while he does not expect U.S. officials to focus
on this point, he believes the attacks against the interests and citizens of the U.S.
and other Western states are aimed first at overthrowing his government, and
replacing it with a strict Islamic Republic dominated by Salafist leaders. Magariaf
also warned that tribal militias loyal to the Qaddafi family continue to present an
equally dangerous threat to the new Goverment.)

Hi Cheryl - if Secy Clinton does something related to Expo in Shanghai in Nov during APEC, assuming she goes, I'd really
like to try to meet her there. Incidentally, If she goes to Shanghai, it would be viewed as odd for her not to visit the Expo
site, given the personal interest she has taken in the matter. xo - jose

LIBYNGREAT BRITAIN/FRANCE
On the morning of April 8, an individual with direct access to the leadership of the Libyan National Council (LNC) stated in
strictest confidence that members of the Military Committee of the LNC are concerned that despite the involvement of
NATO against the forces of Muammar Qacidafi, the government of Great Britain is using its intelligence services in an
effort to dictate the actions of both the LNC and the Qaddafi regime. These individuals add that they have been informed
by contacts in France and Italy that while they have been engaged in discussions with the LNC regarding possible
assistance, British diplomats and intelligence officers have maintained contact with members of the Qadclafi government,
in an effort to protect the British position in the event the rebellion settles into a stalemate. These LNC officials believe
that the defection of Libyan Minister of Foreign Affairs Mouse Kousa to the United Kingdom was part of this effort By the
same token they believe that British intelligence officers are in discussion with associates of Safi al-Islam Qaddafi,
regarding future relations between the two countries if he takes over power from his father and implements reforms.
According to these individuals, senior LNC military personnel suspect that despite early indications that they would
provide clandestine military support to the rebels; neither the French nor the British government will provide the rebels
with enough equipment and training to defeat Qaddafi's forces. They also believe that the French. British, and other
European countries will be satisfied with a stalemate that leaves Libya divided into two rival entities.
(Source Comment: in the opinion of these individuals the LNC military leaders are considering the possibility of hiring
private security firms to help train and organize their forces_ One of these individuals added that a number of the LNC
members believe that this solution may be best for the rebels; noting that if they accept clandestine aid from France
and/or Great Britain those two countries will be in a position to control the development of post-Qaddafi Libya)

1.With little hope of achieving a quick military victory, the LNC is deploying a three part strategy; leveraging tribal
relationships, oil production and diplomatic pressure to get the better of Qaddafi. A former spokesman for the Libyan
Human Rights League (LHRL) in Europe, Ali Ziciane, is in talks with representatives of tribes in Sebha and Sirte in an
effort to persuade them to rally to the revolution and the LNC before fighting actually reaches their regions. Zidane is a
candidate to be the Minister of the Interior in the ""new Libya."" Among his close associates is Mohamed Allagui, president
of the LHRL, who is interested in the justice portfolio in the future, transition government
2. At the same time, All Tarhouni, the LNC's financial expert and possibly Finance Minister in post-Qaddafi Libya, is
struggling to get oil exports back on track in eastern Libya, with backing from the United States and Qatar. The LNC
believes that the U.S. will focus on restarting operations at the oil terminal in TGWU*, and an American envoy is expected
in Benghazi in the near future to facilitate this process. For its part, Qatar is advancing cash to the LNG to stimulate the
shipment of oil from eastern Libya. Some commodity traders stepped in recently (under contract from Qatar) to deliver
refined oil products to the insurgents. VITOL and the Swiss firm GLENCORE are operating in the rebel zone, but denied
any involvement in this shipment.
Elsewhere, these sources add that Materna:I Shannmarn is overseeing the information and communications campaign for
the rebels against Qaddafi. Considered one of the LNC most important leaders, Shammam brings to the insurgency the
expertise he acquired while working forVoice of America, Foreign Policy, Newsweek and Al Jazeera. Shammarri lived in
the U.S. for more than twenty years, and he is believed to have excellent connections in the U.S. Government.
3. Islamist activity: Libya's Islamist activists have maintained a low profile since the start of the insurgency in late
February; fearing that their activities would give credence to Qaddafi's claims that the rebels are terrorists. As the LNC is
taking shape, they are now working to make their voice heard, and influence events within the LNC, All Saliabi, Salem Al
Shiki and Mohamed Al Guirtili, leading Islamic figures who had taken refuge in London (and are close to the Moslem
Brotherhood), drafted a ""national pact"" which looks like a road map for organizing the role of the Islamist movement in the
transition to a post — Qaddafi Libya,
Sallabi and his two associates draw their inspiration from the ""February 17 Movement' which helped spark the uprising by
commemorating the massacre of Islamist prisoners at the Abu Salim prison in 1996. Prior to the current rebellion,
Mustapha Abdel Jail!, the President of the LNC and former Minister of Justice called for the release of reformed Islamists.
At present, the Islamists are handicapped by the fact they supported Saifs reform projects before the recent crisis. Saif
played a crucial part in getting the Islamists to sever ties between the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group's and al Qa'ida in the
Islamic Maghreb (AQIM).
EGYPT AND LIBYA:
A source with excellent access to the highest levels of the SUPREME COUNCIL OF THE ARMED FORCES (SCAF)
states that the Egyptian Military has turned its full attention to the crisis in Libya. Traditionally, Egypt is a strong influence
in the eastern Libyan region of Cyrenaica and is now taking advantage of the current crisis to regain that position.
Regardless of whether Muammar Qaddafi remains in power or not, the political division of Libya will give Egypt the
opportunity to fill the void in the east. A senior diplomatic source reported that since the early days of the Libyan crisis, the
Egyptian government has been quietly supporting Libyan opposition forces through training, weaponry, food, and medical
supplies, while attempting to organize a political structure in the east. In addition, Egyptian Special Operations troops are
serving with mitel forces in the eastern part of Libya. Senior Egyptian military officers stated privately that these troops
are responsible for many of the rebel's combat successes.
The following factors are the focus of Egypt's plans for a post-Qaddafi regime:
-Avoiding a refugee crisis. In the event Qaddaffs forces invade the east, Egypt is the most logical destination for
refugees from Libyan. Egypt has an interest in controlling any turmoil in Libya that could harm efforts to restart its
struggling economy.
-Labor market. Libya is an important market for unemployed Egyptian laborers. According to the Egyptian Labor
Ministry, around 1.5 million Egyptians reside and work in Libya, sending home an estimated $254 million in remittances.
In the past few years, Qaddafi has placed heavy restrictions on foreign workers, and Egypt hopes that a new regime will
be more flexible, and open to receiving Egyptian workers.
-Radical Islamists. Traditionally, the eastern part of Libya has been a stronghold for radical Islamist groups, including
the al Qaida-linked Libyan Islamic Fighting Group. While Qadclafi's regime has been successful in suppressing the
jihadist threat in Libya, the current situation opens the door for jihadist resurgence. Egypt has a growing interest in
keeping a close eye on jihadist movements in eastern Libya. This is especially true as the Egyptian Military is already

concerned about Islamist militancy overflow from Gaza, after their forces were pulled back to Cairo during the uprising
against Mubarak.
-Oil and energy resources. Egypt has strong economic interests in the oil rich eastern part of Libya. Any opportunity to
gain direct or indirect access to these energy resources will increase Egypt's wealth.
-Regional power. The Egypt's military-led government is looking to reestablish their country's role in the Arab world. So
far, Egypt has fostered discussions in the Palestinian territories between Fatah and 1-lamas, while reaching out to Syria
and Saudi Arabia on the issue of Iran.
(Source Comment According to a sensitive diplomatic source, the current Egyptian diplomatic strategy is to enhance its
stature by defending the Libyan people against Qaddafi's regime, while at the same time, distancing itself from any
military intervention led by the region's former colonial powers in Europe.)
It should be noted that, in the opinion of knowledgeable sources, Egypt cannot count on the support of every Arab power
in the region. Egypt led the call for imposing the no-fly zone in Libya, while Algeria, while Yemen, and Syria voted against
it. These countries (especially Yemen) fear the precedence that would be created for their own governments in the event
Qaddati is ousted.
(Source Comment: A source with access to the leadership of NATO state in confidence that their information indicates
that Syria and Algeria are concerned with Egypt's revival in the region. This source stated that a de facto split between
eastern and western Libya would give Egypt the opportunity to reassume an influential position in Cyrenaica.)

Holds, delays on Cabinet picks hurting American businesses
By Nelson W. Cunningham - 10/06/09 03:45 PM ET
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05760158 Date: 07/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05760158 Date: 07/31/2015
You may never have heard of the Under Secretary of Commerce for International Trade, or the Under Secretary of
Treasury for International Affairs. You may have vaguely assumed there was a Deputy United States Trade
Representative, and an Assistant Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere Affairs, and an ambassador to Brazil, but
never thought much of them or what they do.
But ask American CEOs and business leaders who they turn to in Washington for help getting a fair shake in foreign
markets or untying global trade knots, and you will learn that these are the very officials they rely on. Yet today, when
every export dollar and trade-supported job is essential to America's economic recovery, these key positions sit empty.
And, surprisingly, these five seats are empty because of stalls and behind-the-scenes maneuvers by Senate Republicans
— usually key allies of U.S. business.
In each case, the names went up months ago. The nominees have strong credentials and many have demonstrated
strong bipartisan support. The reasons for the holds and delays vary. But even if the blocking actions are unrelated,
collectively they deny American businesses their most effective overseas advocates.
•Miriam Sapiro, who was unanimously approved by the Finance Committee in July to be Deputy United States Trade
Representative with responsibility for trade agreements and enforcement with Europe and the Americas (including
NAFTA), has a one-man hold by Sen. Jim Bunning (R-Ky.) over a Canadian tobacco bill.
•Arturo Valenzuela, nominee for Assistant Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere, was overwhelmingly approved by
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in July, but Sen. Jim DeMint (R-S.C.) has a one-man hold on Valenzuela as a
protest against the administration's Honduras policy.
•Thomas Shannon, nominee for ambassador to Brazil, is also being blocked by Sen. DeMint over Honduras. Shannon is
hardly political, but is a career foreign service officer who was President Bush's top official for Latin America at the NSC
and then the State Department.
•Francisco Sanchez, nominated in April to be Under Secretary of Commerce for International Trade, responsible for
advancing U.S. export and trade opportunities around the world. Republican staff under Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) on
the Finance Committee have repeatedly delayed a hearing.
•Lael Brainard, nominated in March to be Under Secretary of Treasury for International Affairs, is also being held up by
the Republican staff on the Finance Committee. With an empty chair in this powerful position — it was previously held
by future Treasury Secretaries Timothy Geithner and Lawrence Summers — our ability to coordinate a response to the
financial crisis is hampered at a time when we can't afford it.
Who is hurt by these holds and staff delays? Certainly the president, who is facing the worst economic crisis in 50 years,
a stalled trade agenda, and economic and political turmoil in many parts of Latin America, including the hot-button crisis
in Honduras.
But U.S. businesses are also hurt. When American companies find themselves in commercial or trade disputes abroad, or
face unfair competition from foreign companies or discriminatory practices from regulators, they turn directly to the
roster above. With all these chairs empty, U.S. businesses with problems abroad find themselves facing a classic
Goldilocks problem — the Cabinet secretaries above are too big (and too busy), and the officials below are too small to
have an impact at the right levels.
Moreover, the international economic issues of greatest interest to U.S. businesses are precisely the ones that are being
hampered by these vacancies: balanced and coordinated growth out of the Great Recession, promotion of job-
generating U.S. exports, delayed trade agreements with Colombia and Panama, barriers into Brazil's huge market, trade
tensions with Canada (our largest trading partner) and security and border issues with Mexico (our second-largest),
among many others.

And while all U.S. business interests overseas are affected by these vacancies, it is our business and political interests in
the Americas that are being hit most directly, because of the responsibilities and expertise of the five nominees.
Predictably, this lamentable situation is renewing cries from our neighbors that even under a promising new president,
they continue to be neglected. And as importantly, our ability to help shape political and economic events in our
hemisphere to advance U.S. interests is suffering greatly. Who wins when we can't act? Our foreign competitors; not
just foreign companies, but Hugo Chavez and his anti-democratic allies.
All this is not to cast blame on the United States Senate, which has a constitutional duty to provide ""advice and consent""
on presidential nominations (though it may cause one to question the tradition that permits a single senator to put an
indefinite hold on a nominee). Nor is it to cast blame solely on Republican members or staff. Democratic senators and
their staffs used these same parliamentary maneuvers under Republican presidents.
But it is to say that those who engage in those tactics now — at a time of global economic crisis and with growing
financial, trade and political frictions in our own hemisphere — should be reminded of the harm done to important U.S.
interests. In the days after 9/11, the Democratically-controlled Senate moved swiftly to confirm the U.N. ambassador
and other stalled security-related posts. Today's circumstances are not the same by any means, but as we confront the
worst economic crisis in over 50 years, these are surely no ordinary times.
The time has come for the Senate to carry out its constitutional duty and to end the delays on these five key commerce
and trade nominations. American business deserves an A Team by its side.

David Petraeus told Congress Friday in closed hearings that the CIA believed from the start that the September
1 attacks on the U_S. consulate in Benghazi o,,ere by terrorists. That leaves one VIP xvho'S snil missing from
Congressional serAny: Hillary Clinton.
GOP Congressman Peter Kin!! said Mr. Petracits`s testimony differed from what the former CIA director told
Congress itnim2diately after the attacks. Mr. King also said Mr. Petraeus said that the CIA's orig.inal talking
poii t. on the attacks were cditt.d. The. 21t.,::'red version beealrie the basis '.or U.N., Ambassador Susan Rice's
misieading and now infamotis comm<iints hiamino the aitacks on a YouTube video. Both that discrepancy aild
the :Sate of the altered talking points need further digt:iing. especially if Ms. Rice is nominated to be the next
Secretary of State.
But Mr. Petraeus wasn't responsible for lax consulate security or the U.S, policy that led to the Libya debacle.
That's Mrs, Clinton's bailiwick. Last month in interviews from deepest Peru_ the Secretary of State said ""1 take
. .
responstbility"" for Benghazi.

Except she hasn't. She was conveniently out of the country for this week's House Foreign Affairs hearing, and
Senate Foreign Relations Chairman John Kerry refuses to hold any hearings on Benghazi. His loyalty may get
him a cabinet job, while Carl Levin's Armed Services Committee also pretends nothing much happened in
Libya.
The targets of the attacks and its first victims were diplomats. Chris Stevens died of smoke inhalation in the
blaze, becoming the first American ambassador killed in the line of duty in over 30 years. A junior colleague
also died. These men were Mrs. Clinton's ""responsibility."" Several hours after the assault on the consulate,
members of the jihadist militia Ansar al-Shariah turned on the CIA compound about a mile away, killing two of
Mr. Petraeus's men.
In Congressional hearings last month, career State officials admitted that threat warnings from Benghazi were
overlooked and requests for better security turned down. They said Foggy Bottom misjudged the ability of a
weak Libyan state to protect them. It's not clear how high up the chain these concerns went, but over to you,
Mrs. Clinton.
For over a week after the attacks, the Administration blamed the YouTube video. Mrs. Clinton didn't push this
misleading narrative in public as enthusiastically as Ms. Rice. Still, she bought into it. The father of Tyrone
Woods, a CIA contractor who was killed in Benghazi, told media outlets last month that Mrs. Clinton tried to
comfOrt 'him by promising that the U.S.-based maker of the video would be ""prosecuted and arrested""—though
terrorists killed his son.
Beyond the Benghazi attacks is the larger issue of the Administration's Libya policy, a failure that Mrs. Clinton
should also answer for. At the start of the Libya uprising, Washington hid behind the U.N. Security Council to
resist calls for intAentions Mrs. Clinton's department then made the mistake of agreeing to a U.N. arms
embargo on both the Gadhafi regime and the rebels. This blunder forced the rebels to look elsewhere for
weapons and .cash, particularly Gulf states like Qatar that favored Islamist militias.
As Gadhafi's threes were about to overrun Benghazi in March, the Arab League, Britain and France called for
military intervention. Only after the Security Council gave the green light--when Russia abstained—did NATO
launch air strikes, American cruise missiles and bombers led the way, but efs_ iiiseef, President Obarna pulled
the U.S. out of a leadership combat role.
The U.S. also waited until July to recognize the Benghazi rebel opposition as ""the legitimate governing
authority,"" after Luxembourg and 25 other countries had already done so. The war lasted until October. much
longer than necessary.

American disengagement continued after Gadhafi fell. Though rich in oil, Libya's well-intentioned new leaders
needed advice and encouragement to build a functioning state. The most pressing need was to rein in the anti-
Gadhafi militias and stand up a national army. But the U.S. was reluctant to follow up with aid or know-how.
(See our December 24, 2011 editorial, 'MIA on the Shores of Tripoli."") Qatar and the United Arab Emirates
stepped in with money and weapons, again favoring Islamist groups.
The Libyan people nonetheless voted in elections this summer for secular, pro-Western leaders. Yet the
government has limited powers and lacks a proper army. The militias have stepped into the vacuum, while al
Qaeda-style training camps proliferate in the hills around Benghazi.
This abdication is the backdrop to what happened on September 11. The large CIA outpost in Benghazi was
supposed to monitor jihadists and work with State to round up thousands of mobile surface-to-air missiles in
Libya. Yet it turns out that it's hard to fight terrorists on the ground with drones from remote bases. Without a
functioning government or broader U.S. aid, a small Islamist militia was able to target foreign diplomats and
eventually lay siege to the U.S. compound. The CIA closed its entire Benghazi shop that very morning--an
abject retreat.
For weeks, the Administration has tried to shift blame for Benghazi to the ""intelligence community."" Mr.
Petraeus's fall makes him an easy scapew.oat, even as Mrs. Clinton takes a valedictory lap at State and sets her
sights on a 2016 Presidential run.
But U.S. Libya policy has been her handiwork, and with the exception of the fall of Gadhafi it is a notable
failure. Mrs. ClinA is also a main architect of U.S. policy in Syria. which continues to descend into disorder
that may engulf the region, She shouldn't get a free pass from Congress.

Re: Morsi's private conversations & coordination with Magariaf
SOURCE: Sources with direct access to the Libyan National Transitional Council, as well as the
highest levels of European governments, and Western Intelligence and security services.
1. Late in the day on September 14, 2012, Egyptian President Moharriad. Morsi told senior
European diplomats that he is increasingly concerned the current anti-U.S. and anti-Western violence
spreading through Cairo and into the rest of Egypt may be part of an effort by his Salafist political
rivals to destabilize his government, which many of them believe is too moderate in its positions
regarding Islam, Israel, and the non-Muslim world. According to this source, Morsi, who is in
Brussels for meetings with the European Union (EU), was particularly concerned over a message from
Army commander General Abdel Fatah al-Sissi, that Islamist guerrillas, believed to be drawn
primarily from the Sawarki Bedouin tribe, had launched an attack on a base of the International
Peacekeeping Force (IPF) in the Sinai. The General reported that the 1500 United Nations troops at
the base, including some U.S. forces, were under heavy attack and casualty figures were not yet
known. Morsi stated that this fight was an example of radical anti-government forces and Salafist
Islamist dissidents taking advantage of the current situation to carry out attacks that demonstrate his
government is unable to protect Western personnel and facilities in Egypt. Morsi stated that the
success or failure of his regime is directly tied to his ability to establish a moderate Islamic state that
can work with western business interests.

2. (Source Comment: In the opinion of this individual, the current wave of violence is related
to an ongoing struggle between Salafist and Sufi Muslims throughout Egypt. What makes it more
frustrating for Morsi is that much of the violence appears to be inspired by members of the Salafist al
Nour Party, the coalition partner of Morsi's Freedom and Justice Party (FJP) in the new Egyptian
Parliament. According to this individual, Morsi delayed condemning the initial attacks on the U.S.
Embassy out of concern that his opponents would use such a statement to move against his
government. Late on the evening of September 13, 2012, Mohammed Badie, the Supreme Guide of
the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood (MB), sent a message to Morsi warning that he and the Supreme
Guidance Council were concerned that the situation around the U.S. Embassy was getting out of
control and that, difficult as it might seem, he had to take tough measures against the demonstrators,
and protect the interests of the U.S. and other Western Governments. In a telephone discussion with
Saadi al-Katany, the MB/Freedom and Justice Party (MB/FJP) Speaker of the lower house of
parliament, Morsi admitted that he had felt constrained from acting, given his past history of poor
personal relations with the leaders of al Nour. Al-Katany urged him to gain control of the situation.)
3. On September 14, Morsi also stated to an EU official that he had received extremely forceful
messages from both the U.S. State Department and the Office of the U.S. President, leaving no doubt
in his mind that the U.S. —Egyptian relations and more than $ibillion in U.S. aid were at stake in this
matter. Morsi added that since much of this aid goes to the Egyptian Army, he and al-Katany agreed
that actions that put it in jeopardy would also damage the new Egyptian administration's current
good relationship with the Army. Accordingly, Morsi instructed the military and security forces to use
all necessary force short of lethal measures to protect U.S. and Western facilities. In a private
conversation, Morsi stated that he felt he is losing control of the political situation and fears that if the
current fighting results in deaths, either of demonstrators, U.S. diplomats, Egyptian security
personnel, or UN peacekeepers, the situation may spin out of control and his government could fall.
Al-Katany agreed, but said that taking no action would guarantee disaster. They agreed that when the
situation calms down they will have to deal with the al Nour party, which they fear will, in the future,
take advantage of circumstances to try to destabilize Morsi's administration. With this in mind, Morsi
ordered al-Sissi to direct the commanders of Military Intelligence (MI -Mukhabarat el-Khabeya) to
step up operations collecting information on the activities of the al Nour leadership, focusing on any
contacts with potentially violent Salafist dissidents.
4.(Source Comment: A separate sensitive source also noted that General al-Sissi is warning
Morsi about press reports that the person who made the controversial internet film at the heart of this
situation is an Egyptian Coptic Christian. The General cautioned that as this report gains wider
circulation, the government and the Army must prepare for violent attacks by Islamists against that
community, which makes up ten (10) percent of the Egyptian population.)
5. A separate sensitive source noted that for his part, al-Sissi is prepared to to have his troops
take harsh measures against any demonstrators who attack Western personnel and facilities. The
General is also concerned that the al Nour leaders are even more dangerous than Morsi realizes, and
he has ordered the MI to increase technical and physical surveillance of these individuals. In
addition, he stated in private that Morsi and al-Katany spoke with Libyan President Mohammed
Yussef el Magariaf, and they had all agreed that military and security officials in Egypt and Libya will
cooperate in an effort to track links between the violence in Cairo and Benghazi. Al-Sissi has ordered
Special Forces units to step up patrols in the Egypt-Libya border region, while the MI will monitor
communications between dissidents; primarily Salafists, in both countries. According to this source
the General is convinced that these dissidents are seizing the opportunity presented by the current
unrest to move against the governments of Morsi and al-Magariaf. He also received permission from
Morsi to step up cooperation with his counterparts in the U.S. and Western Europe to deal with this

situation and al-Sissi believes al-Magariaf has given similar instructions to Libyan military and
security officials.
6. (Source Comment: According to a separate sensitive source, al-Sissi believes that, given his
new orders from Morsi, the Army can, for the most part, protect Western facilities and personnel in
Egypt. But the General is concerned that the security services can never completely eliminate the
threat from small well organized bands looking to carry out terrorist attacks. Following discussion
with Libyan security officials he believes they have the same concerns.)

It is almost inevitable in an election year that Republicans use every possible opportunity to attack the Obama.
Administration. Part of these attacks have been effort to embarrass the President by turning the killing of
Ambassador Stevens into a ""goteha"" contest where the President is somehow blamed for largely local security
decisions and ""intelligence failures."" The Administration, in turn, has fumbled the situation by going into a state
of confused denial – focusing on the uncertain chronology of events that led to Ambassador Chris Stevens'
death.

The Republicans seem to be ""winning"" in political terms, largely because so few Americans in think tanks and
the media realize that virtually all intelligence and security post-mortems on such events uncover the same
problems. Once the event is over and clear patterns emerge, there are always warning indicators that could have
been heeded in retrospect. If one ignores that vast amount of ""noise"" from other conflicting indicators, and
looks back with 20-20 hindsight, every such event is always an ""intelligence"" failure.
Moreover, competent security officers always are asking for more support and coverage in any area where risks
exist. There is never enough security even in the best funded times, and these are not the best funded times.
Almost every aspect of U.S. diplomacy has been subject to budget cuts at a time of upheaval in the Arab world
and global economic crisis.
A recent article by Dana Milbank in the Washington Post notes that the same Republican dominated House that
now critiques events in Libya cut State Department operations by $300 million in 2009 and eliminated funds for
some 30 more security positions along with it. The House cut security funding by $128 million in FY2011 and
$33! million in FY2012, although the Senate restored $88 million. Under at least one of Congressman Ryan's
proposals to amend the budget, State Department funding would be cut by an additional 20% million in 2014 –
which means another $400 million cut in security.
It is no tribute to the Obama Administration that it did far too little to push back against these cuts, and even
less to articulate the need to fund stronger U.S. ""expeditionary diplomacy"" efforts. Indeed, at a time when far
too many countries are in crisis and the U.S. faces increased challenges to its regional goals, more funds,
stronger country teams, increased humanitarian aid, beefed-up military assistance, and on-the-scene diplomacy
is needed to support U.S. interests.
In fairness to Secretary Clinton and the large number of dedicated diplomatic professionals, State has tried to
deal with these challenges by refocusing its diminishing resources, strengthening its ability to provide on-the-
scene aid, and creating civil efforts that can deal with crises like Syria and the need to provide stronger U.S. aid
and advisory teams if dictators like Assad fall.
So far, both the Republican ""gotcha"" efforts and the Administration's failure to make the case for strong
""expeditionary diplomacy"" have totally failed to serve the U.S. national interest, and have been the worst
possible memorial to Ambassador Chris Stevens, a man who clearly knew that America's success required risk
taking and action in the field.
It is time we come to grips with the world we actually live in. We can't deal with the political upheavals in a
single Arab country, the impact of Transition in Afghanistan, the internal struggle for the future of Islam,
energy and trade security, the various national crises in Latin America and Africa, or the competition for the
future of Asia by speeches in the U.S., quick visits by senior U.S. officials, outside radio and TV programs, and
empty rhetoric about taking stronger stands or exporting U.S. values.
We need strong country teams, and teams that are active and take risks. We need men and women on the scene
who accept the realities on the ground in the countries they operate in. We need strong country teams that can
work with the full range of factions, provide help in forming political parties and changing governance, provide
carefully selected aid and advisory efforts to catalyze reform, and provide military and security advisors that
can help countries move towards stability without excessive repression and threatening their neighbors.
We need to protect our embassies, consulates, and military advisory groups, but we cannot afford to turn them
in to fortresses that lock our diplomats, aid teams, and military on the scene away from events and the people
they are trying to influence. If there are any real lessons from Libya —or Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq, Yemen,
Somalia, Kenya, Tanzania, Saudi Arabia, Lebanon and all the other nations on the long list of cases where
American diplomats, advisors and security teams died to serve their country it is that projecting any form of

smart power is done on the ground, is done by moving throughout the country, is done by taking risks, and will
inevitably incur casualties.
Some will be ambassadors, some will be aid team personnel or experts in public diplomacy, and some will be
CIA or men and women in uniform. Every one of them will be a tragedy. But we cannot let either false
economies or extremist and terrorist threats defeat such efforts. The cost of properly funded expeditionary
diplomacy —people, military and civil aid funds, and fully funded security efforts —is going to be cheaper
even on a global level than losing contact and U.S. influence in a single country like Egypt, or being unprepared
to deal with the flow of events in a nation like Syria or Iraq.
It is also already all too clear that extremist elements throughout the world realize that attacks on U.S. diplomats
and military advisors or partners are one of the cheapest and most effective ways to gain immediate visibility,
strike at the heart of U.S. public opinion, drive the U.S. out of a country, or limit its influence. No one needs to
defeat U.S. military forces — which can only be deployed to a handful of countries at most —if they can expel
or paralyze American diplomacy, support for U.S. businesses and investment, support for U.S. NG0s, and
effective U.S. military and security advisory efforts.
This threat is already all too real in far too many parts of the world, and it has effectively eliminated one of the
key differences between ""hard"" and ""soft"" power. ""Soft"" power cannot survive where it is not protected by
""hard"" power. Moreover, there are few if any crises cases where advice and aid in politics, governance,
economics and rule of law can be separated from a matching need for advice and aid in addressing military,
security, counterterrorism, and national police concerns.
In short, we do not need ""gotcha"" post-mortems or half-formed defenses. The tribute we really owe
Ambassador Chris Stevens is to undertake the following eight steps:
• Understand that diplomacy will often be a form of asymmetric warfare in crisis countries, particularly
those with crumbling regimes or new unstable governments. Accept the fact there can be no success
without taking increased risk and suffering casualties.
• Set realistic and achievable goals country-by-country and give the ambassador and country team as
much discretion as possible. Don't set impossible goals for instant democracy, human rights, rule of law
or stability. Accept the need for evolutionary action and ""doing it their way."" Don't try one size fits all
ideological solutions or efforts from Washington.
• Stop focusing on narrow budget cuts and examine the costs and benefits of effective, well-funded
country team efforts. If properly funded diplomacy and country team efforts only win support for the
U.S. in one crisis country over the next decade, or avoid even one armed intervention, they will still
more than pay for their costs in terms of the U.S. budget, and the overall effort will be immensely more
valuable in terms of gains (and tax revenues) in U.S. trade and investment.
• Reexamine how to create all of the elements of ""expeditionary diplomacy"" efforts, including strong
country teams, and the ability to suddenly boost teams in countries in crises, with the full range of tools
an ambassador needs. This includes adequate staff, operating and security funds, and flexible aid funds
that can be applied quickly to deal with changing needs and circumstances.
Fully fund security but find the best ways to change existing procedures to emphasize mobility and
move to high-risk areas. Refocus intelligence to help reduce risks, and restructure protection efforts to
provide specially trained and equipped U.S. and foreign national security. Stop doing pointless security
post-mortem blame games and focus on the future.
• Reward and encourage necessary risk taking. Make it clear that this is a key part of a successful career
path, that it will be fully supported by State and other agencies deploying U.S. personnel, and reorient
security efforts in country to protect such efforts in the best ways possible rather than creating rules that
either make effective action impossible or force diplomats and advisors to violate such rules without
protection. Anyone who works with U.S. diplomats, aid workers, and military advisory teams overseas

knows that we have strong cadres ready and willing to take such risks. The challenge is to properly
support them in country and reward them for their service.
Reexamine the insurance coverage, benefits, and salaries of such risk takers. Don't sustain the present
situation in Afghanistan and earlier in Iraq where contractors get massive wage increases and diplomats
and aid workers lack the full equivalent of combat pay and protection for them and their families if they
are killed or disabled. Ensure adequate lasting medical care for lasting injuries.
Finally, see if there is some way the U.S. Congress can address these issues realistically in a way that actually
focuses on U.S. national interests even in a time of petty partisan feeding frenzies. These efforts not only need
the next Administration to fully fund and support them at a time of growing budget pressures, they need
bipartisan support in both Houses of Congress.
There will be a need for outside review, for new reporting requirement and for hearings. But, they need to look
forward. U.S. efforts must serve national interests rather than personal or partisan advantage, accept the
complexity and time needed to deal with country-by-country efforts, and focus on pragmatic ways of dealing
with the future rather than dissecting the past.

Still working this through, but here is where we are thus far:
The majority of all countries that have direct presidential elections use a Two-Round system. The number appears to be
at least 58.
France, most Latin American countries, all five post-Soviet Central Asian republics, and many countries in francophone
Africa use TRS to elect their presidents. Elsewhere in Africa the system is used by Angola, Cape Verde, Gambia, Ghana,
Guinea-Bissau, Kenya, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, Sao Tome and Principe, the Seychelles, Sierra Leone, Sudan,
Tanzania, Uganda and Zimbabwe; in Europe, apart from France, it is used by Armenia, Azerbaijan, Austria, Belarus,
Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Finland, Georgia, Lithuania, Macedonia, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Slovakia, Slovenia

You should have received two faxes stacked together accidentally. The one you want says ""9 pm"" on the top left. I am
sending the remaining pages (about 5-6) now. The one that says 8:15 pm is the wrong version so ignore it.

Subject: Quick readout from Jeff Feitman in Tried
Jeff asked me to pass along the following readout. Please excuse the free-form list of subjects but I wanted to get this
out quickly to as wide an audience as possible. Please feel free to share with others I've missed.
1. State of Embassy Tripoli facility: While admitting he is no engineer, Jeff agrees with the initial OBO assessment
that the facility is not salvageable — the condition is ""shocking and photos doesn't do it justice.' Floors have
collapsed, the ballistic glass and metal support beams have melted, and it has been totally trashed. Jeff asked
for their help on Embassy security; they took this on board but noted that they are still in the process of trying to
secure the country.
2. Abdel JAI and Mahmoud fibril both to NY next week: Both will travel to NY next week for the high level
meeting on the 20th. Jain will then return to Libya, and Jibril will remain in NY to deliver the Libyan address to
UNGA on the 24th. The plan is to have the new cabinet in place by the 2e,with Jibril the likely PM. Jeff pressed
them on including a woman on their UN delegation. He also made all of the points about the need for the INC
to take the lead in NY in outlining what they are seeking from the int'l community but they didn't share their
ideas about what they will say.
Action needed: Jalil needs a visa,
understand MAG is working this now but we will need to facilitate issuance (likely by Embassy Tunis).
1 Saadi Qadhafl and Niger: Jibril has sent a letter to Niamey and is sending the Deputy FM there to talk about
Saadi. The Libyan request to Niger will be two-fold: 1. Detain him properly (they understand he is free to roam
about 2. Be prepared to return him to Libya to stand trial.
4. Weapons issues: They will ask OPCW to come back and they want them to say yes but the Libyans are picking
up noises from OPCW that they can't accept a request from the INC now because the INC is not a UN
member. (comment: I know the credentials issue is being worked this week in NY but Ken Ward please convey
to OPCW that they need to take the Libyans up on their request asap.)
S. OUP mandate: they think NATO should stay beyond an additional 30 days (I told Jeff I thought we were now
looking at 90 in any case).
6. Pan Am 103: Jeff raised the issue with Jaill and the Justice Minister, which they took on board; Justice Minister
said ""this was a crime against humanity so Libya has to cooperate.""
7. Treatment of Libyans of color and African migrants: Jeff raised and they responded with the right things.
8. Oil fund paper: Passed to INC.
9. ""Boots on the ground"": they asked about the comments they had seen and expressed their concern over
them. Jeff explained that these were people to help provide security for our people and facility and why they
were necessary.

evening. President Zelaya addresses the General Assembly tomorrow morning at 11:00 am, so USUN needs to be
instructed this evening.
The bureaus are happy to co-sponsor, as long as the resolution stays substantively the same. The draft text is below:

American Killed in Libya Was on Intel Mission to Track Weapons
Before Death, Ex-SEAL Glen Doherty Told ABC News He Helped Round Up Dangerous
Shoulder-Fired Rockets
By LEE FERRAN
Sept. 13,2012
One of the Americans killed alongside Ambassador Christopher Stevens in an attack on a U.S. diplomatic
mission in Libya Tuesday told ABC News before his death that he was working with the State Department
on an intelligence mission to round up dangerous weapons in the war-torn nation.
In an interview with ABC News last month, Glen Doherty, a 42-year-old former Navy SEAL who worked as
a contractor with the State Department, said he personally went into the field to track down so-called
MANPADS, shoulder-fired surface-to-air missiles, and destroy them. After the fall of dictator Moammar
Gadhafi last year, the State Department launched a mission to round up thousands of MANPADS that may
have been looted from military installations across the country. U.S. officials previously told ABC
News they were concerned the MANPADS could fall into the hands of terrorists, creating a threat to
commercial airliners.

Doherty said that he traveled throughout Libya chasing reports of the weapons and once they were found,
his team would destroy them on the spot by bashing them with hammers or repeatedly running them over
with their vehicles. When ABC News spoke to Doherty in late August, he was enjoying a short time off in
California before heading back to Libya just days ago.

The State Department declined to comment on Doherty's involvement in the IVIANPADS program, but
pointed to a previous statement from State Assistant Secretary for Political-Military Affairs Andrew
Shapiro in which he said the department was looking at ""every possible tool to mitigate the threat.""
According to military records provided to ABC News, Doherty joined the Navy in 1996 and was a combat
medic and a decorated member of the elite SEAL teams by the time he left active duty in 2004. He's
described in glowing terms as a top-tier SEAL and better friend in the book ""The Red Circle,"" written by
Doherty's longtime friend and SEAL sniper school partner, Brandon Webb.
""Glen was a superb and respected operator, a true quiet professional,"" Webb told ABC News today. ""Don't
feel sorry for him, he wouldn't have it. He died serving with men he respected, protecting the freedoms we
enjoy as Americans and doing something he loved. He was my best friend and one of the finest human
beings I've ever known.""
Doherty's mother, Barbara, told ABC News' Boston affiliate WCVB she had been notified of her son's death
late Wednesday.
""He was the most wonderful person,"" she said. ""We are all in pain and suffering.""
Ambassador Stevens and State Department information management officer Sean Smith were killed in the
first wave of attacks in Benghazi when the building they were in was set on fire around 10 p.m. local time
Tuesday, a senior administration official told reporters. Doherty was apparently one of two other
Americans who were killed in a firefight nearly two hours later, while the facility was still under attack.
The State Department has not officially released the names of those Americans.

Hi! Hope you all are getting some R&R as the summer wanes.
Your Africa trip has generated a lot of visibility and momentum on women's issues. I wanted to follow up on an idea we
discussed, when we met a few months ago, for raising the profile of women's issues and creating a unique platform for
you in the U.S.
You may recall that Melanne and I were developing ideas for holding events to connect people working on women's
issues around the world, and to raise the visibility of the issues in the US.
Whitney Williams has joined us to flesh out a vision for a series of conferences that would bring together policymakers
and experts from the field with women you have met around the world - and people at the grassroots level in this
country.
Each conference would be followed by a special event featuring musical, cultural and culinary celebrities (yep, celebrity
chefs) from the U.S. and other countries to generate visibility online and in the entertainment media, which would reach
a lot more people than the policy conference alone.
These events would create connections among people who often work in isolation, and generate ideas for improving
policies and practices. They'd also inspire and engage a whole new generation to get involved in global women's issues.

This approach — bringing together policy, grassroots and entertainment aspects — isn't being done by anyone else in the
development space. It would be a great way to raise the visibility of the issues, and your work on them, here at home.
We could put on several over the next year, with one on the 15th Anniversary of your UN speech in Beijing.
If you're interested, we'd like the chance to meet with you all to discuss it. (Perhaps we could get together when
everyone is in town for Capricia's swearing-in.) Would you like to do that?

Status update on the Chris Stevens mission to Benghazi:
The current game plan is for Mr. Stevens to move no later than Wednesday from Malta to Benghazi. He will stage off
shore initially for a one day visit during which he will have meetings with TNC interlocutors and get a sense of the
situation on the ground. The goal of this one day trip is for him to lay the groundwork for a stay of up to 30 days.
He will be accompanied by a DS team, a staff member from Embassy Tripoli and the leader of USAID's DART team. With
the support of Ambassador Cretz and Embassy Tripoli, Mr Stevens is in contact with TNC members on the ground in
Benghazi and elsewhere; the team is also in contact with other diplomatic missions and NGOs in Benghazi. We expect to
get support in particular from the Turks who have a consulate in Benghazi.
Mr. Stevens team has been in touch with Africom planners on the details of the mission. We have made the official
request for support from OSD but have yet to get approval. Once we have that — and we hope that will be very soon --
we will be able to move forward with the planning.

If our early assessment of today's election in Honduras holds, we will have just been witness to a remarkable thing:
Honduran voters have taken back their democracy from two failed leaders -- Zelaya and Micheletti -- who had driven
Honduras to isolation and despair.
The turnout (probably a record) and the clear rejection of the Liberal Party shows our approach was the right one, and
puts Brazil and others who would not recognize the election in an impossible position. As we think about what to say, I
would strongly recommend that we not be shy. We should congratulate the Honduran people, we should connect
today's vote to the deep democratic vocation of the Honduran people, and we should call on the community of
democratic nations (and especially those of the Americas) to recognize, respect, and respond to this accomplishment of
the Honduran people.
Finally, this Administration, which worked so hard to manage and resolve this crisis, should be the one who defines the
results and perceptions of today's vote, and not our critics on the Hill (who had no clear pathway to elections) or our
adversaries in the region (who never wanted this day to happen).

bilateral meeting worked as planned.
And while I'm writing, here is about the most straightforward piece about HRC ever written in the NY Times - with this
classic line: ""...a Liberian man with a long wooden horn followed her around most of the visit, blowing out loud funny
noises whenever she said something striking.""
Clinton Ends Africa Tour, Vowing to Stay Involved By JEFFREY GETTLEMAN The New York Times
Published: August 15, 2009
SANTA MARIA, Cape Verde - After a grueling seven-nation, 11-day trip, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton
wrapped up her Africa tour on Friday by reaffirming her promise to renovate American relations with the continent.
""I leave Africa after this remarkable trip even more committed,"" Mrs. Clinton said before leaving Cape Verde.
""I have seen the joy and energy Africans have, evidenced not just by the boogieing, but by the hard work and
perseverance,"" she said, referring to a recent comment from her husband, former President Bill Clinton, that she knew
how to ""boogie"" with African dancers.
""And we've seen the worst humanity can do to itself,"" she added, presumably referring to Congo, where Mrs. Clinton
met victims of a brutal civil war that just does not seem to end.
Mrs. Clinton seemed satisfied that she had accomplished her mission: strengthening American relations with crucial
allies on the continent, like Nigeria and South Africa, and sending a message of ""tough love,"" as she called it, to nations
like Kenya and Congo.
Over all, she said, the United States wants to work more closely with African nations as a partner, not simply as a patron
or dispenser of aid. In exchange, she said, African leaders must deliver democracy and good government.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05759228 Date: 06/30/2015
Mrs. Clinton vowed to stay on top of Africa, even after she gets back to Washington, closely monitoring the issues she
addressed on her tour. She also pointed to Cape Verde, a set of palm-studded islands best known for their beaches and
enormous tourist hotels, as an example of what good leadership can do.
""This is possible,"" she said. ""You create not just economic growth but a sense of human dignity and possibility.""
Kenya. South Africa. Angola. Congo. Nigeria. Liberia. And finally Cape Verde. Mrs. Clinton saw with her own eyes some of
Africa's most promising countries - and some of its most troubled ones. In Kenya, she pushed for the government to
prosecute perpetrators of the postelection violence last year. In South Africa, the big issue was Zimbabwe and how the
South African government should do more to help ease the crisis there.
In Angola, the theme was good governing practices and oil, a strategic concern of the United States given the many
inroads China has made there and elsewhere in Africa in its hunger for natural resources. In Congo, Mrs. Clinton was
passionate about the need to end the nation's rape epidemic.
""The secretary's visit to the heart of the world's deadliest war zone in eastern Congo was a potential game-changer for
that conflict,"" said John Prendergast, a founder of the Washington-based Enough project. ""Her commitment to
addressing root causes such as the conflict minerals that power our electronics industry was a refreshing contrast to the
usual disaster sympathy tourism of visiting dignitaries.""
""Now,"" he added, ""comes the hard part: making good on the promises and living up to the high expectations
engendered by her visit.""
In Nigeria, Mrs. Clinton pressed for electoral changes. In Liberia, she praised the country's president, Ellen Johnson
Sirleaf, the only woman in Africa to be elected head of state.
The Liberian visit had a special warmth, almost like a meeting of long-lost cousins. Liberia was founded in the 19th
century by freed American slaves, and the country's flag, the people's names and even the police uniforms with plastic-
brimmed hats were all reminiscent of the American versions. Mrs. Clinton received possibly her most exuberant
welcome there, and a Liberian man with a long wooden horn followed her around most of the visit, blowing out loud
funny noises whenever she said something striking.
""I love that - the horn - I want to take that guy with me wherever I go,"" she said.
In Cape Verde, Mrs. Clinton seemed to have few bones to pick. For once, she said, she had a cheat sheet on a country
that included a list of far more positives than negatives. The country has fewer than 500,000 people and has escaped the
turmoil that has engulfed so much of Africa. The all-inclusive, poolside buffet resorts here feel like something found in
Canci.ln or the Bahamas.
Mrs. Clinton called Cape Verde ""a model of democracy and economic progress in Africa.""
On Friday, just as she had at every stop, she started her speech by saying, ""I bring you greetings from President Obama.""
She called him a ""son of Africa"" and said that under the Obama administration, the United States was determined to
help Africa reach its promise.

We've sent word that she's going to call (I think Davu is in Slovenia but should be available). I think we've got
agreement on the text after another word change or two, and Davu will know that the key issue is agreeing on a date for
a signing and submission to parliaments. We've told the Turks that it ""should be"" in early October. They will push back,
and if they agree to a date at all it will probably be Oct 12. That will be much harder to sell to other side, but our

I know you're embarked on another big trip and wish you well.
I met with Reema Navatany, Ela Bhatt's right hand, whom you know. She sends her greetings and underscored again
what you mean to them. SEWA is on the cutting edge of so many exciting developments.
We had a great conversation on many things, including how much women in the developing world can and must do to
address climate change and drive low tech green industries. In the villages, I could feel the pollution in my eyes and
throat -- so much needs to be done at the local level. Much pollution is produced because of the way women cook, etc.
When I get back, will work up some ideas on this. Delhi's been enshrouded in smog for the last couple days.
The SEWA project I visited 2 hours outside of Delhi was so impressive. Women who were among the poorst of the poor
had become businesswomen capable of traveling to London and Brussels to negotiate contracts with companies for
their embroidery etc We're going to have SEWA play a key role in the Vital Voices summit that you announced that will
take place here next year.
Maria Otero was still here when - arrived so she joined me for the SEWA mtgs.
I also went to one of Rushira Gupta's antitrafficking projects. You know her as we've been working with her thru WH
years. She got the global citizens award at CGI this year. I don't think I've seen worse conditions than what she's trying to
address. In Mumbai we launched an anti- trafficking campaign with Bollywood which brought in new players to the
cause.
Tomw, I will be speaking on this year's World Economic Forum Gender Gap report for India. There's so much potential
for India's economic growth -- as the WEF points out --- if they'd tap women's potential here. India is last of the BRIC
countries on most indicators and comes out poorly generally. Will be raising some of these issues with govt in Dialogue
mtgs.
Anyway, I thought of you so much everywhere I went. I'm so happy to be part of your legacy on these issues.
Travel well.

Re: New president of Libya
SOURCE: Sources with direct access to the Libyan National Transitional Council, as well as the highest levels
of European Governments, and Western Intelligence and security services.
1. During early August, 2012, Libyan National Transitional Council (NTC) President Mustafa Abdel
Jalil held discreet meetings with Mohammed Yussef Magariaf, the then leader of the newly elected General
National Congress (GNC), who Jalil learned was to be named interim President of Libya when the NTC stepped
down. During these sessions the two leaders worked out the transition to a new, elected interim Government for
Libya; focusing on the need to restore stability and security by disarming the militia units which fought in the
2011 revolution against former dictator Muammar al Qaddafi. According to a source with excellent access to
both parties, _Tani came away from the meeting convinced that Magariaf is intent on becoming Libya's first
elected president following the overthrow of Qaddafi. Jalil was pleased to learn that Magariaf strongly supports
the three-party Cairo Declaration negotiated between the NTC and the Governments of Tunisia and Egypt in
late July allowing for increased trade and a relaxation of existing travel restrictions.
2. According to this individual, Jalil and Magariaf agree that Tunisia and Egypt hold the key to Libya's
future economic success, with Libya providing the funding for new projects, while Egypt and Tunisia provide
technical expertise. Magariaf stated privately that this relationship marks a departure from the Qaddafi years
when Libya's natural resources fell under the control of foreign firms and governments. Jalil added that
Magariaf will welcome investment and cooperation from American and Western European banks and

corporations, but believes Libya, supported by the new governments rising out of the Arab Spring, must
maintain control over all aspects of the industries involved in exploiting its natural resources. In this regard,
with the support of both Jalil and Magariaf, the Libyan Ministry of Finance is increasing the level of Libyan
investment in the Cairo stock exchange. In turn, Magariaf and Egyptian President Mohamad Morsi discussed
increased Tunisian and Egyptian investment in the Benghazi stock exchange as the economic situation in Libya
becomes more orderly.
1 In commenting on the new Interim President, Jalil added that Magariaf s current position is bolstered
by the fact that he is not tied to any particular faction. At the same time he has maintained the respect that is
attached to his role as the first Libyan leader to direct an armed revolt against Qaddafi. This fighting was
carried out by the rebel Libyan National Army in 1981. Magariaf is an academic and diplomat with well
established Islamist credentials and good relationships with business and government leaders in the United
States and Western Europe. A separate sensitive source noted that one interesting issue to watch is Magariaf s
relationship with General Khalifa Belqasim Haftar, the commander of one sections of the new Libyan Army.
Haftar has been at odds with many of the militia commanders and is currently leading Libyan forces in the
Kufra region, attempting to end local tribal fighting and block the smuggling of arms and supplies to pro-
Qaddafi militias by supporters based in South Sudan. In the years between 1981 and 1990 Haftar (then Colonel
Haftar) commanded the rebel Libyan National Army, under Magariaf s National Front for the Salvation of
Libya (NFSL). One source notes that Magariaf s opposition to Qaddafi was based on the dictator's betrayal of
Islamic principles, a position that, at that time, was supported by the Western Allies.
4. According to this individual, Jalil also spoke with former Prime Minister Mahmoud Jibril, who
indicated that he and Magariaf agree on many issues, including the belief that they can build an Islamic state in
Libya that can function in the world economy and the international diplomatic community. He did note that he
believes Magariaf s view of the role of Islam in the day to day function of the government is more conservative
than his, but these are differences that can be sorted out in the GNC. In the opinion of this individual Jabril is
well aware of the fact that, while his National Force Alliance (NFA) controls a solid bloc of thirty nine (39)
seats in the GNC and Magariaf s National Front Party (NFP) holds no seats in its own right, the interim
President has established good working relationships with at least 100 of the 120 independent members of the
GNC. Magariaf received 113 votes in his election as Interim President. Again these independent deputies
respect Magariaf s role in fighting the Qaddafi regime.
5.(Source Comment: This particularly sensitive individual stated in strict confidence that Magariaf sees
his role as establishing an efficient interim government, while overseeing the drafting of a new constitution and
election law. This individual believes that Magariaf is very interested in winning the presidency under this new
law. Besides meeting with Jalil and Jibril, Magariaf is talking to liberal politicians including former Oil and
Finance Minister Ali Tarhouni, and the leaders of the Muslim Brotherhood's (MB) Justice and Construction
Party (JCP), including Mohamad Sowan.)
6. This individual adds that Jalil believes Magariaf will face a very difficult period as he addresses the
many issues left unresolved by the NTC and the interim regime of Prime Minister Abdel Rahman el-Keib. Jalil
has been highly frustrated by el-Keib's inability to disarm the many militia units left over from the 2011
revolution against Qaddafi. At the same time he has advised Magariaf to move quickly in replacing el-Keib's
cabinet while deciding which ministers to retain. The new interim government is facing a problem of
lawlessness and attacks against foreigners, including representatives of the Egyptian Government; this at a time
when the new Muslim Brotherhood government of Egypt is reaching out to increase business and diplomatic
contacts between the two countries. According to a sensitive source, Libyan military intelligence officers
believe these attacks are the work of Qaddafi loyalists, while former NTC officials fear that they may be carried
out by dissident Islamist groups, frustrated with the results of the national elections, which many of them

7. (Source Comment: An extremely sensitive source stated in confidence that Libyan Military
Intelligence officers reported to Jalil and later Magariaf that a series of bombings in Tripoli and Benghazi
appear to be the work of Qaddafi loyalists looking to create tension between the Libyan and Egyptian
Governments. These attacks included the ear of an Egyptian diplomat, which was blown up near his home in
Benghazi, a day after several deadly bomb attacks in the capital Tripoli. At the same time, a homemade bomb
exploded under the vehicle of the Egyptian consulate's first secretary Abdelhatniti Rifai in one of the Tripoli's
most affluent neighborhoods. No one was hurt during this attack. Earlier in August, three car bombs exploded
near the Ministry of Interior in Tripoli, killing two people and wounding three others. This sensitive source
added that security officers arrested 32 members of what they describe as an organized network of Gaddafi
loyalists linked to the attacks. During this period, the Red Cross suspended its activities in Benghazi and
Misrata after one of its compounds in Misrata was attacked with grenades and rockets. In late July seven
Iranian relief workers associated with the Libyan Red Crescent were kidnapped by tribal troops still loyal to the
Qaddafi family. Security officials have no word on the whereabouts of these relief workers.)
8. According to this source, while the Cairo Declaration received a positive reception among Libyan
political and business leaders, it also created a drastic increase in the number of Libyan's applying for Egyptian
visas under the new, simplified process. This workload has created a backlog of applications, and in mid
August, a group of Libyan nationals frustrated with the Egyptian visa process attacked the interior of the
Egyptian consulate in Tripoli. These Libyan applicants were angry about the time it was taking to receive visas
to enter Egypt and were demanding that the staff work past their stated hours of operation. A sensitive source
noted that a number of Libyans destroyed the furniture in the main waiting room and attacked the consulate.
The Magariaf Government has assured the Egyptian ambassador that additional security personnel will be
assigned to guard the Embassy, at least until the visa backlog is reduced.

Huma, Joe, Jake,
We are likely to have one candidate against Hosni in round 4 of the UNESCO director general race on Monday.
EU Commissioner Ferraro-Waldner has pulled out formally.
Our UNESCO Amb. Killion reports that candidates Baki (Ecuador) and Bukova (Bulgaria) met Sunday night Paris time.
Baki has given Bukova an ultimatum. Either they form a unity ticket with Ivonne Baki on top or Baki leaves the race.
Tonight former Ferrero-Waldner supporters are considering how to vote. Mexican Dep Secretary for 10 issues called
me. They are wondering whether to support Baki in round 4 now that F-W is out.
I noted that we wanted the strongest of the ladies to stay in (Fyi, they both were on our list of the most qualified
candidates.) Too early a pull out could also affect the race.
The Egyptian candidate could lose because of a consolidation of alternative candidates.
I am sorry to report that the Egyptians have used harsh tactics in the halls of UNESCO. A member of the U.S. delegation
has seen a member of the Egyptian-hired ""public relations"" group walking around with an envelope of cash. They
pushed to have two Amb recalled. Disgust and resentment is running high.
The Egyptians are pushing delegations very hard. FM Aboul-Gheit has stopped in Paris to deal with the UNESCO race
while en route to NY for UNGA.
A/S Feltman writes that Egyptian Ambassador Shoukry has called him twice todaY with a ""message from the Foreign
Minister."" FM Aboul Gheit is angry and reports President Mubarak is angry.

A/S Feltman notes"" maybe we've become a convenient excuse."" A/S Feltman very helpfully pushed back and helped
defend our ambassador who had been criticized.
Our strategy relies on our Amb being low-key. He is following his instructions. We should be unhappy with the way he is
being attacked personally. Candidates Bukova and Baki are moving ahead on their own lobbying. FYI, Hosni even said
on French TV that the U.S. is neutral reflecting our especially low key approach this past week. Now that Hosni may
lose, the U.S. looks like a convenient one to blame.
Events will continue to develop among the candidates and voting delegations. The Monday 9am Paris time Europeans'
meeting could indicate Bukova's relative support and offer a chance to reveal any Baki-Bukova deal if there is one.
Meanwhile Egyptian pressure is likely to continue at UNESCO on Monday.
Monday's vote is midday EDT.

Isn't a surprise since 5 years ago he removed his brother as official crown prince.
Basically he's not honoring his fathers dying wish but since constitution says it should be son (with brother as option) he
has clear authority to do it. I personally think this shows confidence in his position as he's not worried about an outcry
from his fathers loyalists.

Libyan Ambassador's Death Not a Political Issue, Says Dad
By Margaret Talev on October 14, 2012
BusinessWeek
Bloomberg News
The father of Christopher Stevens, the U.S. ambassador to Libya who was killed in the attack in Benghazi last month, said
his son's death shouldn't be politicized in the presidential campaign.
""It would really be abhorrent to make this into a campaign issue,"" Jan Stevens, 77, said in a telephone interview from his
home in Loomis. California, as he prepares for a memorial service for his son next week.
Mitt Romney, the Republican nominee, has criticized President Barack ()barna for not providing adequate security in
Libya, saying the administration has left the country exposed to a deadly terrorist attack.
The ambassador's father, a lawyer, said politicians should await the findings of a formal investigation before making
accusations or judgments.
""The security matters are being adequately investigated,"" Stevens said. ""We don't pretend to be experts in security. It
has to be objectively examined. That's where it belongs. It does not belong in the campaign arena,"" Stevens said he has
been getting briefings from the State Department on the progress of the investigation.

'Very Optimistic'
Stevens said while he was dose with his son, ""we weren't that familiar with the day-to-day activities' he undertook in
Libya. On the occasions when his son called home, Stevens said, he didn't share many details about his work other than
to say that ""he was very optimistic about the results of the election and the new government."" They last spoke by phone
in August and by e-mail days before his son's death.
Stevens, a registered Democrat, said he isn't politically active. He declined to say how he'll vote in the presidential
election.
He said his son, who was a career diplomat and had worked for Republican and Democratic presidents, hadn't expressed
concerns to him about security or support from the administration. ""He felt very strongly about Secretary Clinton,""
Stevens said, referring to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. ""He felt she was an extremely able person.""
As for whether he had the tools and protection he needed for his job, Stevens said of his son: ""We didn't get into that""
sort of discussion. ""I never heard him say a critical word about the State Department or the administration, or any
administration for that matter, He came up through the foreign service, not politics.""
Obama Call
Stevens said neither of the two presidential campaigns reached out to him, and that he is grateful for that. He said
Obama telephoned him after his son's death to express his regrets and talk about identifying the perpetrators who
should be brought to justice, and that the conversation was in the context of his presidential duties and not political.
While polls indicate that voters say Obama would do a better job on foreign policy issues, Republicans see an
opportunity to cut into that advantage, pointing to surveys showing that voters have grown less satisfied since the Sept.
11 assault in Libya.
Stevens stopped short of directly criticizing either candidate.
""I'm not sure exactly what he's been saying and not saying, but our position is it would be a real shame if this were
politicized,"" Stevens said, referring to Romney. Our concern now is memorializing Chris and remembering his
contribution to the country.""
Campaign Shift
Romney's current foreign policy position marks a shift in tone from a campaign that has focused almost exclusively on
economic issues arid jobs.
The Romney team is attempting to link two campaign messages by charging Obama with weakening American interests
abroad at the same time as he's failed to boost the economy back home.
Speaking to voters on Oct. 12 in Richmond, Virginia, Romney chastised Vice President Joe Biden for his defense of the
administration's actions in the Libya attack.
""He's doubling down on denial, and we need to understand exactly what happened as opposed to just having people
brush this aside,"" Romney said.
During last week's vice presidential debate, Biden said the White House wasn't told of a request for additional security
at the mission in Benghazi the month before the incident.

State Department official Eric Nordstrom, who served as a regional security officer in Tripoli until July, told a
congressional committee that he was turned down when he requested an extension of a 16-member security support
team that was scheduled to leave Libya in August.
'Mission Creep'
Romney hasn't specified what he would do differently than the administration In Libya. In a speech at the Virginia
Military Institute earlier last week, he called for support of Libya's ""efforts to forge a lasting government"" and to pursue
the ""terrorists who attacked our consulate.""
That view is at odds with the position Romney took more than a year ago, when he opposed expanding the intervention
in Libya to capture Muammar Qaddafi, calling it ""mission creep and mission muddle"" in April 2011.
Neither the administration's initial public report that the attack began with a spontaneous demonstration against an
anti- Islamic video clip nor Republican suggestions that it was a planned attack tied to al-Qaeda are supported by U.S.
intelligence reports or by accounts of the night provided to a Bloomberg reporter by Benghazi residents.
White House Press Secretary Jay Carney told reporters that ""the president wants to get to the bottom of what
happened.""
Carney also sought to minimize questions about why the president and other administration officials were slow to
publicly acknowledge the role of terrorism in the attack.
""As time went on, additional information became available,"" Carney said. ""Clearly, we know more today than we did on
the Sunday after the attack. But as the process moves forward and more information becomes available, we will be sure
to continue consulting with you.""

July 7, 2012 national elections to be complicated and sometimes violent; however, according to a knowledgeable
individual, he is particularly concerned by the level of control exerted by regional militia's and political groups on the
electoral process. In the opinion of this individual, Jalil and his advisors believe that, given the level of suspicion and
frustration felt in the various parts of the country, it will be difficult for the new 200 seat General National Congress (GNC)
to establish its authority, draft a new constitution, and establish new national government. With this in mind, Jalil stated in
extreme confidence that the NTC may have to remain in power until the situation becomes stable and a new government
is firmly in place. That said he still plans to have interim Prime Minister Abdel Rahman el-Keib step down after the
election results have been certified. The NTC will then work with the GNC as it takes shape to choose a new Prime
Minister and Cabinet. Jalil would like to keep several ministers from the el-Keib government in the new regime,
particularly Minister of Defense Ousama al-Juwali.
2. According to this individual, Jalil wants to maintain a degree of security and stability in an effort to reassure
foreign businesses and banks that Libya will not descend into civil war and chaos. At the same time, the NTC must deal
with the regional issues that divide the country's three electoral regions: Tripolitania in the West, Cyrenaica (Barge) in the
East, and Fezzan in the South. In the weeks leading up to the election the failure of the NTC to resolve these differences
has strengthened the federalist movement in Barge while antagonizing the tribal leaders in the South. Both groups are
calling on their followers to boycott the election while the Southerners are calling for the National Army to withdraw its
forces from the area around the town of Kufra, where they are deployed to stop fighting between tribal militias. At the
same time, on July 1 federalist supporters attacked electoral offices in Benghazi, protesting the influence of Tripoli and the
Western region on the upcoming elections.

3. (Source Comment: In the opinion of a knowledgeable individual, the division of the 200 seats in the GNC lies
at the heart of this matter, with 120 seats allotted for the Tripolitania, 60 for Barqa, and 18 for the Fezzan area. At
present, the Libyan Muslim Brotherhood (LMB) and its political arm, the Justice and Construction Party (JCP), are
attempting to mount a national campaign, receiving discreet advice and technical support from the Egyptian Muslim
Brotherhood (EMB). With this assistance, Jalil is convinced that the JCP is the party that operates most effectively
throughout the country. Jalil has established ties to the EMB, from whom he has learned that JCP leader Mohamad
Sowan and his associates are working with the leadership of the EMB.)
4. According to his sources, Jalil believes that he can work with Sowan and the LMB/JCP; however, he is
concerned that Mohammed Morsi, the newly elected EMB President of Egypt, and EMB Supreme Guide Mohammed
Badie are focused on developing Egyptian influence in Libya. Jalil has been informed privately that these EMB leaders
want to establish a strong position in Libya, particularly in the oil services sector as part of their effort to improve Egypt's
economic situation. Libyan officials in Cairo and Jalil's own associates are warning him that the Egyptians may see the
NTC as a potential barrier to their effort and are advising Sowan to press for an early withdrawal of Jalil and the NTC from
Libyan politics. For his part, Jalil has attempted to avoided direct conflict with the LMB/JCP, focusing his attention, and
that of the el-Keib interim government on trying to deal with the unrest in the period leading up to the national elections.
5. According to a particularly sensitive source, Jalil believes that Sowan will need the assistance of the Libyan
National Party (LNP), the Islamist group led by religious scholar Ali al-Salabi and former Islamist militant
General Abdel Hakim Alamin Belhaj to gain enough seats to control the GNC. While there are significant personal
conflicts between Sowan and Belhaj, Jalil believes that the two groups could work together to gain control of the
government. In this case, Jalil believes the new regime would move quickly to oust the NTC, and establish a more
conservative Islamist regime. At the same time, since the LNP is a Tripoli based movement, Jalil fears that the tribal
federalists in Barqa might react violently to them gaining an important role in the new government. Since the Barqa
leaders are urging their followers to boycott the election, a strong role for the LNP in coalition with the LMB/JCB could
lead to calls for Barge to secede from the Libya. (Source Comment: The LNP is dominated by the former leaders of the
Libyan Islamic Fighting Group (AI-Jamala al-Islamiyyah —LIFG), who, according to sensitive sources, maintained ties to al
Qa'ida during their struggle with the forces of former dictator Muammar al Qaddafi.)
6. Former interim Prime Minister Mahmoud Jibril is leading the National Forces Alliance (NFA),
an umbrella coalition of liberal parties that received Western support for efforts to overthrow the regime of Muammar al
Qaddafi. While Jibril is not on the list of candidates, his presence in the NFA leadership is seen by Belhaj and other
Islamists as an effort by the United States and Western Europe to manipulate the election. Jalil does not believe that the
NFA can gain control of enough seats in parliament to play a significant role in the new government. According to this
source, Jalil believes that former Oil and Finance Minister Ali Tarhouni also plays an important role in the NFA.
7. At the same time, Jafil is watching the progress of a second moderate party, the National Front (NF), which is
based on the work of a 1980s-era anti-Qaddafi exile organization. The party is led by Mohammed al-Magariaf, an exiled
intellectual dissident leader from a prominent Eastern Libyan family. Jalil's sources advise that the NF is also backed by
the al-Sennusi tribe, the former Libyan royal family, who may be looking to play a role in a semi-autonomous or
independent Barqa. One particularly sensitive source noted that many of the NF leaders have ties to the United States,
Italy and the United Kingdom, and at one point Jalil believed that the NF might be able to work with the NFA; however,
personal differences between the leaders of the two parties made effective cooperation difficult.
8. (Source Comment: In the end, a particularly sensitive source stated in confidence that Jalil believes the
LMB/JCB will have a significant role in the new government, possibly supported by the LNP. However; he points out that
since accurate polling is nonexistent it is impossible to predict a victor with any accuracy. Jaill also noted that it is quite
possible that no group will win a clear victory, which, when added to the boycotts and pre-election violence may require
the NTC maintain control of the country for some time to come. Accordingly, he has instructed al-Juwali to prepare to use
the National Army to maintain order. For his part Al-Juwali has warned that this will be a difficult task since the best units
of the Army, including many of its armored forces are deployed in the Kufra region of the Southeast, in an effort to control
tribal conflicts, stem the flow of weapons into the country from South Sudan, and resist Qaddafi loyalists amongst the
nomadic tribes of the region.)

Re: Libyan leadership and militias
SOURCE: Sources with direct access to the Libyan National Transitional Council, as well as the
highest levels of European Governments, and Western Intelligence and security services.
1.During the last week of December 2011, and the first week of 2012, Libya's Prime Minister
Abdurrahina el-Keib and President Mustafa Abdul Jai engaged in a series of emergency planning
meetings attempting to deal with specific issues threatening the stability of the new National
Transitional Council (NTC) Government According to extremely sensitive sources speaking in strict
confidence, paramount among these issues are the questions of disarming and rewarding the regional
militias who bore the majority of the fighting against the regime of Muammar al Qaddafi, as well as
the related issue of finding ministers and senior administrators for the new government who are
acceptable to these revolutionary forces. These individuals noted that on four occasions, beginning on
December 23, 2011, groups or angry militiamen came to el-Keib's office and demanded better
treatment, a clear message of support for the role of Islamic law, and the removal of former Qaddafi
advisors from the new government
2. (Source Comment: In the opinion of a very sensitive source, el-Keib is genuinely concerned
that this situation could spiral out of control and threatens the regime. He also suspects that much of
the unrest is being stirred by General Abdel Hakim Mamin Belhaj and his conservative Islamist
supporters. By staying out of the new government, Belhaj has established a position from which he
can criticize their actions and appointments without concern or control, That said, el — Keib has been
told by his contacts in the Moslem Brotherhood (MB) that even Belhaj has been surprised that the
unrest in the militias has begun to manifest itself in fighting between groups that previously shared
the same goals and operated under Belhaj's loose command, This is particularly true in the case of
the increasingly violent conflicts between the Misrata and Zintan regional militias.)
3. In an effort to address these problems el-Keib is making changes in his new administration,
removing Minister of Economics Taher Sherkaz, who, as a former economic advisor to Qaddafi, was a

told by his contacts in the Moslem Brotherhood (MB) that even Belhaj has been surprised that the
unrest in the militias has begun to manifest itself in fighting between groups that previously shared
the same goals and operated under Belhaj's loose command. This is particularly true in the case of
the increasingly violent conflicts between the Misrata and Zintan regional militias.)
3. In an effort to address these problems el-Keib is making changes in his new administration,
removing Minister of Economics Taher Sherkaz, who, as a former economic advisor to Qaddafi, was a
particular target of the militiamen. In the opinion of well informed individuals, el-Keib's closest and
most influential advisors are experts with economic backgrounds and experience dealing with
Western firms and governments. The most influential of this group are Minister of Oil Abdulrahman
Ben Yaw, Minister of Finance Hassan Ziglam, National Oil Company chief Nuni Berrusien, and Ngeb
Obeda from the Libyan Stock Exchange.
4- (Source Comment: In the opinion of a very sensitive source, el-Keib and Jalil are also very
concerned over growing criticism that these technocrats are puppets of various Western governments
and firms. Belhaj and the militiamen appear intent on limiting the influence of these Western
entities, using them as a weapon to weaken the el-Keib regime. This trend is also affecting national
security, where, despite el-Keib's efforts to maintain a balance between the Islamists, regional
commanders, and the national army, a potentially dangerous conflict has arisen over the position of
Chief of Staff of the National Army. El-Kieb, according to this individual, believes that he must settle
this matter in short order to avoid provoking security concerns among foreign allies and businesses
'contacts.)
5. According to a knowledgeable individual, in late December 2011e1-Kieb resisted efforts by
General Khalifa Belqasim Haftar to establish himself as the Chief of Staff of the National Army.
Haftar, who lived in the United States for many years and is believed by Belhaj and others to have a
relationship with the U.S. Government, is using his popularity among the officer corps of the regular
NTC army to support his claim to be Chief of Staff. This produced heated protests from militia
leaders and in late December 20 ael-Keib named deputy Minister of Defense Colonel Yussef
Mangoush„ to be Chief of Staff. In the opinion of one source, this is a problematic choice, since el-
Keib is replacing the supposedly pro-American Haftar with al-Mangoush who commanded one of
Qaddafi's elite Special Forces units, even after the revolution began. This individual believes that el-
Keib's decision was driven by personal animosity toward Haftar, and the influence of Minister of
Defense Osama al-Juwali. The situation is far from resolved, as Haftar and his supporters,
particularly in the Benghazi garrison, continue to claim that the General is the true Chief of Staff. El-
Keib and al-Juwali are working to reconcile all of the elements in this conflict as quickly as possible,
before the supporters of the two claimants begin fighting. In the meantime, el-Keib has stated in
private that he fully expects Belhaj to attack al-Mangoush, but the Prime Minister believes that the
Colonel is the only officer strong enough to disarm the militias and avoid a civil war.
6. At the same time, a very sensitive source added that el-Keib and Jail are attempting to
reconcile the fighting between Misrata and Zintan forces in Tripoli by naming Misrata leader Fawzi
Abd Ali as Minister of the Interior and al-Juwali, who was commander of the Zintan militia, as
Minister of Defense. To date, according to this individual, this effort has met with limited success, as
the fighting has continued and the militias are refusing to disarm until their demands regarding living
standards are met.
7. (Source Comment: One very sensitive source noted, that el-Keib is aware of the fact that he

term relationships with Libya. El-Keib believes that Belhaj and his advisors have made the same
judgment, and are waiting to fill any vacuum created by this violence, by establishing a conservative
Islamic Republic.)

Re: Libyan leadership and militias
SOURCE: Sources with direct access to the Libyan National Transitional Council, as well as
the highest levels of European Governments, and Western Intelligence and security services.
1. During the last week of December 2011, and the first week of 2012, Libya's Prime
Minister Abdurrahim el-Keib and President Mustafa, Abdul Jafil engaged in a series of
emergency planning meetings attempting to deal with specific issues threatening the stability of
the new National Transitional Council (NTC) Government. According to extremely sensitive
sources speaking in strict confidence, paramount among these issues are the questions of
disarming and rewarding the regional militias who bore the majority of the fighting against the
regime of Muammar al Qaddafi, as well as the related issue of finding ministers and senior
administrators for the new government who are acceptable to these revolutionary forces. These
individuals noted that on four occasions, beginning on December 23, 2011, groups or angry
militiamen came to el-ICeib's office and demanded better treatment, a clear message of support
for the role of Islamic law, and the removal of former Qaddafi advisors from the new
government.
2. (Source Comment: In the opinion of a vet}, sensitive source, el-Keib is genuinely
concerned that this situation could spiral out of control and threatens the regime. He also
suspects that much of the unrest is being stirred by General Abdel Hakim Alamin Bell* and his
conservative Islamist supporters, By staying out of the new government, Belhaj has established
a position from which he can criticize their actions and appointments without concern or control.
That said, el — Keit) has been told by his contacts in the Moslem Brotherhood (MB) that even
Belhaj has been surprised that the unrest in the militias has begun to manifest itself in fighting
between groups that previously shared the same goals and operated under Belhaj's loose
command. This is particularly true in the case of the increasingly violent conflicts between the
Misrata and Zintan regional militias.)
3. In an effort to address these problems el-Keib is making changes in his new
administration, removing Minister of Economics Taher Sherkaz, who, as a former economic
advisor to Qaddafi, was a particular target of the militiamen In the opinion of well informed
individuals, el-Keib's closest and most influential advisors are experts with economic

backgrounds and experience dealing with Western firms and governments. The most influential
of this group are Minister of Oil Abdulrahman Ben Yezza, Minister of Finance Hassan Ziglarn,
National Oil Company chief Nur Berrusien, and Ngeb Obeda from the Libyan Stock Exchange.
4. (Source Comment. In the opinion of a very sensitive source, el-Keib and Jail are
also very concerned over growing criticism that these technocrats are puppets of various Western
governments and firms. Belhaj and the militiamen appear intent on limiting the influence of
these Western entities, using them as a weapon to weaken the el-Keib regime. This trend is also
affecting national security, where, despite el-Keib's efforts to maintain a balance between the
Islamists, regional commanders, and the national army, a potentially dangerous conflict has
arisen over the position of Chief of Staff of the National Army, El-Kieb, according to this
individual, believes that he must settle this matter in short order to avoid provoking sec.urity
concerns among foreign allies and businesses contacts )
5. According to a knowledgeable individual, in late December 2011el-Kieb resisted
efforts by General Khalifa Belqasim Haftar to establish himself as the Chief of Staff of the
National Army. Haftar, who lived in the United States for many years and is believed by Belhaj
and others to have a relationship with the U.S. Government, is using his popularity among the
officer corps of the regular NTC army to support his claim to be Chief of Staff. This produced
heated protests from militia leaders and in late December 2011el-Keib named deputy Minister of
Defense Colonel Yussef al-Mangoush, to be Chief of Staff. In the opinion of one source, this is
a problematic choice, since el-Keib is replacing the supposedly pro-American Haftar with al-
Mangoush who commanded one of Qadclafi's elite Special Forces units, even after the revolution
began. This individual believes that el-Keib's decision was driven by personal animosity toward
Haftar, and the influence of Minister of Defense Osaina al-Juwali. The situation is far from
resolved, as Haftar and his supporters, particularly in the Benghazi garrison, continue to claim
that the General is the true Chief of Staff El-Keib and al-Juwali are working to reconcile all of
the elements in this conflict as quickly as possible, before the supporters of the two claimants
begin fighting. In the meantime, el-Keib has stated in private that he fully expects Belhaj to
attack al-Marigotish, but the Prime Minister believes that the Colonel is the only officer strong
enough to disarm the militias and avoid a civil war.
6. At the same time, a very sensitive source added that el-Keib and hill are attempting to
reconcile the fighting between Misrata and Zintan forces in Tripoli by naming Misrata leader
Fawzi Abd Ali as Minister of the Interior and al-Juwali, who was commander of the Zintan
militia, as Minister of Defense. To date, according to this individual, this effort has met with
limited success, as the fighting has continued and the militias are refusing to disarm until their
demands regarding living standards are met.
7. (Source Comment: One very sensitive source noted, that el-Keib is aware of the fact
that be is running out of time to stabilize the situation in Libya He believes that if he does not
disarm the militias and meet their demands in the next six months there is a good chance of
increased fighting among rival groups that could lead to civil war. In any event, he realizes that
the ongoing instability will cause Western governments, firms, and banks, to hesitate before
committing themselves to long tern relationships with Libya. El-Keib believes that Belhaj and
his advisors have made the same judgment, and are waiting to fill any vacuum created by this
violence, by establishing a conservative Islamic Republic.)

We've sent Word that she's going to call (I think Davu is in Slovenia but should be available). I think we've got
agreement on the text after another word change or two, and Davu will know that the key issue is agreeing on a date for
a signing and submission to parliaments. We've told the Turks that it ""should be"" in early October. They will push back,

Thanks, Hillary. I don't know about details of Obama's plan, but you looked terrific at the speech. (Lincoln, in 1864, on
Obama's plan: ""The difficulty is not in stating the principle, it is in applying it."") Too bad Rep. Wilson didn't wear a red
pantsuit.
Max continues to rocket--up to #8 overall this am, #1 in every nonfiction category except cookbooks. And last night in an
special election Jackie was elected Advisory Neighborhood Commissioner in DC. It was a hard fought race, in fact, and
her opponent ran a negative campaign against her on email with the slogan: ""She's Not Jackie.""
Here's the draft of the article Max has written on the bad Joe Wilson (membership in racist organization) and that will be
published today. This should do it.
Let's speak when you have time.
Rep. Joe Wilson's Rebel Yell
Inside the racist klavern that Joe Wilson joined By Max Blumenthal
Since Republican Rep. Joe Wilson of South Carolina bellowed at President Barack Obama, ""You lie!"" during the
president's nationally televised speech on healthcare, the fourth term backbencher has emerged as a hero among the
conservative grassroots. One of the most enthusiastic endorsements of Wilson's histrionics came from the Sons of
Confederate Veterans (SCV), a group that Wilson has <a href=http://crooksandliars.com/david-neiwert/obama-heckler-
joe-wilson-member-neo>belonged to</a> for several years.
""Mr. Wilson, never apologize for allowing your love of truth to overrun your desire to be polite,"" the SCV Tea Party <a
href=http://scvteaparty.com/?p=165>declared</a> on its website. ""It is the liar who must apologize, not the one who
identifies the liar!""
Who are the SCV? A once-proud organization of Confederate history buffs and re-enactors who spent their
organization's money to restore Civil War-era battlefields and Confederate cemeteries, by 2006 the SCV was
substantially <a href=http://www.spIcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?pid=1027 >taken over</a> by an organized
cadre of white supremacist radicals (read <a href=http://www.spIcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?pid=154
>here</a> for more background) who sought to turn the nation's oldest Southern historical society into what the
veteran white supremacist activist Kirk Lyons called ""a modern, 21st century Christian war machine capable of uniting
the Confederate community and leading it to ultimate victory."" When the racist junta had seized much of the SCV's
leadership positions, the Southern Poverty Law Center released an <a

href=http://www.spIcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?sid=90 >extensive list</a> of SCV officials who belonged to
""hate groups.""
Lyons, a key leader of the white supremacists who took over the SCV, had <a
href=http://www.thenation.com/doc/20050829/blumenthal/single >harbored dreams</a> of creating a seemingly
benign front group for a more sophisticated version of the Ku Klux Klan. ""I have great respect for the Klan historically,
but, sadly the Klan today is ineffective and sometimes even destructive,"" Lyons told a German neo-Nazi magazine in
1992. ""It would be good if the Klan followed the advice of former Klansman Robert Miles: 'Become invisible. Hang the
robes and hoods in the cupboard and become an underground org anization."" With the SCV, Lyons discovered he didn't
have to go underground after all.
Once Lyons helped install his close friend, Ron Wilson, as president of the SCV, the organization's political newsletter, <a
href=http://fpacscv.org/southernmercury/ >The Southern Mercury</a> (where Wilson served as senior editor),
transformed into a propaganda mill for crude white supremacist cant. Mailed to all dues-paying members of the SCV —
presumably including Rep. Joe Wilson — until it went defunct in 2008, the Mercury has published articles describing
blacks as genetically inferior to whites, calling African-Americans as ""a childlike people,"" and warned that if Obama runs

of our cities in ruins.""
Here are a few highlights from the Southern Mercury:
""After the turn of the 20th century, the white Southerners had disfranchised and segregated the blacks, in perhaps the
mildest reaction possible at=2 Othat time to the blacks' transgressions. The blacks — then a childlike people — had been
selling their votes to the Democrats en masse for $.25 apiece in national elections.""
—""Where We Stand Now, And How We Got Here,"" by Frank Conner, Southern Mercury, September/October 2003
""Previously, anthropologists had routinely recorded the notable differences in IQ among the races; but at Columbia, a
liberal cultural anthropologist named Franz Boas...decreed that there were no differences in IQ among the races, and the
only biological differences between the blacks and whites were of superficial nature... Meanwhile, the liberals in the
media heaped special praise upon black athletes, musicians, singers, and writers — and treated them as typical of the
black race. The liberals were creating a false image of the blacks in America as a highly competent people who were
being held back by the prejudiced white Southerners.""
--Conner, September/October 2003
""It is very clear to me that if Barack Obama should be elected President, he would be extremely anti-white and would
demand reparations for slavery and press hard for affirmative action to the degree that it would hurt young whites who
were seeking jobs or admission to College and Graduate Schools.""

""Americans Face The Worst Presidential Candidates In History,"" by Robert Slimp, Southern Mercury, May/June 2008
""I believe that [Obama's] rhetoric and anti-white legislative proposals would stir up racial riots. If he were running for re-
election, these riots would turn into an exceedingly violent nature that would seriously damage race relations in
America, and leave entire sections of some of our cities in ruins.""
--Slimp, May/June 2008
Rep. Joe Wilson could have resigned from the SCV as soon as the organization's takeover by open white supremacists
began. But he didn't. Or he could have withdrawn his membership when the SCV's flagship journal turned into a racist
rag. But he didn't. Instead, while serving as a state senator, Wilson led an SCV-inspired campaign in 2000 to keep the
Confederate flag flying above South Carolina's state capitol. ""The Southern heritage, the Confederate heritage, is very
honorable,"" Wilson <a href=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/503579.stm>proclaimed</a> at the time, responding
to critics of the Confederate flag.

I called her because we had a tie for the FSO's and I wanted to see if she'd provide a second monetary award so we
wouldn't have to divide the $5k. She agreed and then told me
State will fly in the awardees and the Secry usually gives out the award. Swanee is hoping that she'll be able to come and

Benghazi's Deep Throat fingers Islamist Leaders for
Attacks as State Dept Criticized on Consular Security
Posted on 12/19/2012 by Juan
The report saying that security was inadequate at the compound that the US had adopted as its ad hoc
consulate in Benghazi, Libya, dominates today's headlines. That conclusion is obvious. The
""consulate"" was just a private residence taken over for this purpose by the US in the city. It was not
constructed to be a US government building in a potentially hostile city.
I met a person who worked there when I was in Benghazi in June, and she told me that it wasn't even
clear if the consulate would be retained after the first of this year. It was possibly temporary,
depending on Congressional funding. (The Tea Party House hasn't been good on meeting requests for
embassy security funds).
The more interesting question than why ad hoc arrangements should have been made for a consulate
during and after the Libyan revolution (the answer to which seems fairly obvious) is, who is
responsible for the string of assassinations and acts of violence in the city, of which the RPG attack on
the consulate on September 11 was only one? Benghazi, with a population of over one million in a
country of 6.5 million, is Libya's second largest city and was the epicenter of the revolution against the
government of Muammar Qaddafi in 2011.
On November 22, Benghazi police chief Farej Darssi was assassinated. In October a police colonel
barely avoided death— his car was wired to explode. A Libyan intelligence officer was killed in
September. A general was assassinated in August. Some of these figures had worked for Qaddafi but
had defected to the revolution. Qaddafi's security forces were responsible for the 1996 massacre of
hardline fundamentalists at Abu Salim prison, and for making others just disappear. Likely the same
shadowy cells that attacked the US consulate are behind the attacks on Benghazi police and army
officers.
There may have been a break in the case. Last Saturday, Benghazi security forces loyal to the elected
government in Tripoli, captured a man they suspected of being involved with the groups behind the
violence. And, he appears to have been willing to spill the beans. So let's call him the Libyan Deep
Throat.
Deep Throat is so knowledgeable about the conspiracies facing the city and so dangerous to those
hatching them that the latter immediately attempted to spring him from jail.

On Sunday morning, militants attacked the police facility next to the holding cell where the man is
being detained. A policeman at that station died in a hail of bullets from the attackers, and they called
for back-up. The police car that sped to the scene was ambushed and three policemen in it were killed.
Still, the police stood their ground and fought off the assault, and they kept their valuable suspect in
custody, with all his valuable testimony.
Shortly after midnight, on Monday morning, small explosives were set off at the Garyounis police
station in Benghazi, damaging a couple of automobiles but otherwise doing little damage. Then
explosives were set off at al-Uruba police station, which also took sniper fire, but neither resulted in
casualties.
The police became vigilant, and they apprehended a shady-looking man skulking around near the al-
Hadaeg police station, finding him to have two rocket propelled grenades in his possession, which he
was apparently intending to fire at the station.
In other words, the capture of Libyan Deep Throat has set off a gang war on the police, who are being
informed by bombings and shootings that they must let their infounant go or risk their
So what is Deep Throat saying? According to local journalist Mohamed Bujenah of the Libyan Herald,
a senior figure in the Benghazi police told him that the informant had fingered as many as 7
prominent Muslim fundamentalist leaders in connection with these attacks, of whom the police
named 6 explicitly:
1 Sayan Ben Quinu, from the notoriously radical town of Derna, and a former prisoner at
Guantanamo
2.Ahmad Bukatela, leader of the Mai& Militia
3.Muhammad al-Zahawi, head of the Ansar al-Sharia militia
4.Muhammad al-Gharabi, a leader of the Rafallah al-Sahafi Militia
5.Ismail Sallabi, another leader of Rafallah al-Sahati
6.Salim Nabous, head of the Zawiya Martyrs' Brigade
It is just a newspaper article. We don't kilow if the informant actually named these individuals or if he
did so to escape torture, in which case we can't trust what he said. But if the allegations are true, there
is collusion among several hardline militias in the city to create instability in hopes of taking it over.
The new, elected, prime minister Ali Zeidan, has started asserting himself militarily. He clod the
country's southern borders against instability in the Sahel. He may well have some risky house
cleaning to do in Benghazi.

Another report---
SOURCE: Sources with direct access to the Libyan National Transitional Council, as well as the highest levels of
European Governments, and Western Intelligence and security services.
1. As of the morning of July 6, an individual with access to the information stated in confidence that Libyan National
Transitional Council (NTC) President Mustafa Abdel Jalil remains committed to a transfer of power to a popularly elected
government; however, he is prepared to extend the life of the NTC as a guarantor of stability for the Libyan people
following the July 7, 2012 election for seats in a 200-member General National Congress (GNC). Jalil realizes that 2.7
million Libyans have registered to vote and are generally anxious to replace the increasingly unpopular NTC. That said,
Jalil expects the voting to lead to a period of confusion and he will not abandon his authority until the results are fixed.
2. Jalil is also frustrated by the fact that during its eight-month tenure of the administration of Prime Minister Abdel
Rahman el-Keib - who was appointed by the NTC — was unable to provide solutions for Libya's long list of needs: a
functioning justice system, a reconciliation process for officials who served the old administration, the disarming of
militia, building functional national security forces, rebuilding destroyed areas, and delivering basic services such as
healthcare.
3. At the same time, outside of the oil sector, much of Libya's economy is stagnant, and in the opinion of Western
security officials, lacks the government's go-ahead to restart public sector infrastructure contracts. In addition,
international advisers and foreign investors are reluctant to return to an environment where the government will not
sign long term agreements and cannot guarantee security.
4. (Source Comment: According to an extremely sensitive source, Jalil continues to believe that this chaotic situation
should not be surprising. He regularly points out that eight months is not a sufficient amount of time to build functioning
institutions from the remnants of the regime of former dictator Muammar al Qaddafi. The old regime featured a
dysfunctional bureaucracy, idiosyncratic rule, and anti-institutionalism. Additionally, Jalil now realizes that due to
pronounced incompetence and a lack of will to take unpopular decisions the el-Keib government also failed to make
progress in the few areas where it could have achieved meaningful change. The towns of Sirte and Tawargha are
representative of the situation in the countryside where people lost their homes in the conflict and have been living in
temporary camps with limited ability to register and vote in their home district. Jalil has been urged by contacts in the
French and Italian Governments to guarantee the rights of people across the country. In particular, he has serious
concerns as to whether or not supporters of former dictator fv1uammar al Qaddafi in his hometown of Sirte will be
included in the future political processes of the new Libya; if they are not allowed to vote by local militiamen. At the
same time the fighting between Libyan Arabs and Tebu tribesmen in the Kufra area threatens to prevent any voting

there. Jalil has been warned that the NTC regulations now state that members of the National Army are not allowed to
vote or run for office, which is a disincentive for armed militia brigade members to become legitimate soldiers.)
5.This well informed individual believes that despite these flaws, the new government created by the July 7 election will
eventually have the mandate to take the difficult decisions that can create a reconciliation process. Jalil will work to
maintain order in this transition period, and finally reach his goal of creating a situation where the government can
rebuild homes and restore sufficient law and order; allowing those in Sirte, Tawargha, Kufra, and throughout the rest of
the country to live in their hometowns, establishing a situation where a true civil society can develop.
6. Jalil, in conversations with the leaders of the Muslim Brotherhood (MB), and separately with liberal leader All
Tarhouni, has acknowledged that the central government's top priority must be security and that the NTC has been
unable to provide it. That said, Jalil and Minister of Defense Ousarna al-Juwali have pledged to provide 30,000 to 40,000
security personnel for election day to 'prevent similar incidents to the July 1 attack on Benghazi's election headquarters.
In that case eastern federalists entered the building, where ballot papers were burned and ballot boxes destroyed.
Similarly, these federalist forces are suspected of the attack on July 5 that burned down Ajdabiyals main storage centre
for election materials.
7. In the opinion of this individual, although those responsible for the Benghazi attack were pro-federalist, it has not
been proven that they were members of the self-appointed Cyrenaican National Council (CNC), whose military arm set
up a roadblock in Wadi al-Ahmar on Libya's major east-west highway to demand that Cyrenaica get as many seats in the
GNC as Tripolitania. Thus far, neither the CNC nor any other group has publicly stated that they intend to use violence to
disrupt the elections. (Note: Under the current system Tripolitania will have 120 seats in the GNC, Cyrenaica (Barqa) 62,
and Fezzan in the South 18.)

September 28, 2012
Statement by the Director of Public Affairs for National Intelligence Shawn Turner on the intelligence
related to the terrorist attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya
In the aftermath of the terrorist attack on U.S. personnel and facilities in Benghazi, Libya, the Intelligence
Community launched a comprehensive effort to determine the circumstances surrounding the assault and to
identity the mpetrators. We also reviewed all available intelligence to determine if there might be follow-on
attacks against our people or facilities in Libya or elsewhere in the world.
As the Intelligence Community collects and analyzes more information related to the attack, our understanding
of the event continues to evolve. In the immediate aftermath. there was information that led us to assess that the
attack began spontaneously following protests earlier that day at our embassy in Cairo. We provided that initial
assessment to Executive Branch officials and members of Congress, who used that information to discuss the
attack publicly and provide updates as they became available. Throughout our investigation we continued to
emphasize that information gathered was preliminary and evolving.
As we learned more about the attack, we revised our initial assessment to reflect new information indicating that
it was a deliberate and organized terrorist attack carried out by extremists. It remains unclear if any group or
person exercised overall command and control of the attack, and if extremist group leaders directed their
members to participate. However, we do assess that some of those involved were linked to gmups affiliated
with or sympathetic to al-Qa`ida. We continue to make progress, but there remain many unanswered questions.
As more information becomes available our analysis will continue to evolve and we will obtain a more
complete understanding of the circumstances surrounding the terrorist attack.
We continue to support the ongoing FBI investigation and the State Department review of the Benghazi terrorist
attack, pmviding the full capabilities and resources of the Intelligence Community to those efforts. We also will
continue to meet our responsibility to keep Congress fully and currently informed. For its part, the Intelligence
Community will continue to follow the information about the tragic events in Benghazi wherever it leads. The
President demands and expects that we will do this, as do Congress and the American people. As an Intelligence
Community, we owe nothing less than our best efforts in this regard, especially to the families of the four
courageous Americans who lost their lives at Benghazi in service of their country

OK. Went through it. It's not too much shorter, but I think it's tighter here and there. Made slight change at end to try
to tie in with how it started to bring full circle.
An area where you could save time and space (but I didn't try to change it) would be to shorten the parts where you talk
about Israel and Palestine and about Iraq and Afghanistan - it seems to me that those are tactical discussions of an
existing issue, and somewhat removed from the more abstract and strategic policy outline she's otherwise aiming at
here.
By the way, the phrase ""global network of diverse partnerships"" seems to be absent now. I kind of liked it on several
levels, but I presume it met some objection along the way...

I just woke up so I missed Dan. Could he come back after I finish my calls? But I don't have the call schedule yet so I don't
