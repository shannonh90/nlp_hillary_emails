Ms. Slaughter,
Again, great talk today at the CNAS annual event. Thanks for your time.
As you will remember, I raised the point that we seem not to be engaging
regimes or populations regarding affirmative visions of what their
societies
could achieve in (say) a decade, if only we invested in a certain
development strategy.
Clearly, you had once heard about the RAND Corporation's Arc Concept
(perhaps from Steve Simon?), for a national infrastructure trunkline for

a
future Palestinian State. To regain familiarity, please watch the 8
minute
video on the home page of www.friendsofthearc.org which provides a great
overview of the Arc vision, and its potential for enabling peace in the
region. This is an affirmative vision that sells very well to both
Palestinians, Israelis and American Jews and Palestinians. I would be
happy
to prove this. Just imagine if the US came out in support of this
vision.
If President Obama simply said something like ""The Arc is a great
example of
a transformational idea which did not originate from American
politicians or
diplomats, but rather from innovative American minds in collaboration
with
stakeholders from all walks of life in Palestine, Israel, the US,
Europe,
and the Muslim world. It's the kind of initiative that I am happy to
endorse, and I look forward to better understanding how, through the
Arc,
America can make a positive contributions to peace, prosperity and
security
in the region."" - some very interesting things would happen. For
example,
the PIF and other forms of private finance might just finance the whole
thing...not requiring any (or at least much) US $.
You don't know me from Adam, but lets just say that I can say with
confidence that PM Fayyad backs the Arc as a key part of his two year
plan
for statehood, and that Abu Mazen's economic advisor (Dr. Mohammad
Mustafa -
CEO of the PIF) does also. And, that President Peres has been a long
time
supporter (I have the letter on my computer). I happen to know that
Zbigniew Brzezinski will soon be taking a package to NSA Jones on the
topic.
Zbig is a huge fan, as are many others from the establishment. If we
met
for 15 minutes, I could explain the nature of the collective action
problem
that has prevented many Arc fans from speaking up, and I could explain
how I
am fixing this problem.
This is a concrete engagement strategy that would not cost the President
political capital, but would actually manufacture political capital.
If you are willing to talk for 15-20 minutes, I would be happy to run up
to
Foggy Bottom to brief you up on the Arc, and where I plan to take it

The defeat of the Child Marriage bill, I fear, is a harbinger of what's to come. After passing the Senate
unanimously, there was every expectation that it would fly through the House on suspension. How this too
became an abortion issue is truly distressing. We have our work more than cut out for us.
On another note, I ran into Ray and Shaista the other night. They were recently in Pakistan and stayed with
Zardari the whole time. It might make sense for someone to brief Ray. Zardari considers him his informal
ambassador to the US.
How Ileana Ros-Lehtinen killed the bill to prevent forced child marriages

l_tot_prevent_forced_child_marriages?utm_sourceafeedbumer&utm_mediumaernall>
Posted: 17 Dec 2010 03:08 PM PST
incoming House Foreign Affairs chairwoman lieana Ros-Lehtinen (R-FL) defeated a bill Thursday evening
that would have committed the United States to combating forced child marriages abroad, by invoking concerns
about the legislation's cost and that funds could be uses to finance abortions. The episode highlights the tough
road that the Obama administration will face in advancing its women's rights and foreign aid agenda during the
next Congressional session.
Non-governmental organizations, women's rights advocates, and lawmakers from both parties spent years
' developing and lobbying for the ""International Protecting Girls by Preventing Child Marriage Act of 2010,"" which
the House failed to pass in a vote Thursday. The bill failed even though 241 Congressmen voted for it and only
166 voted against. because House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) brought it up under ""suspension of the rules.""
This procedure has the advantage of not allowing any amendments or changes to the bill, but carries the
disadvantage of requiring two-thirds of the votes for passage.
Even still, supporters in both parties fully expected the bill to garner the 290 votes needed -- right up until
the bill failed. After all, it passed the Senate unanimously Dec. 1 with the co-sponsorship of several Republicans,
including Appropriations Committee ranking Republican Thad Cochran (R-MS), Foreign Relations Committee
' member Roger Wicker (R-MS), and human rights advocate Sam Brownback (R-KS).
If passed, the bill would have authorized the president to provide assistance ""to prevent the incidence of
child marriage in developing countries through the promotion of educational, health, economic, social, and legal
empowerment of girls and women."" It would have also mandated that the administration develop a multi-year
strategy on the issue and that the State Department include the incidence of forced child marriage during its

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05772091 Date: 08/31/2015
annual evaluation of countries human rights practices.
So what happened? Ros-Lehtinen first argued that the bill was simply unaffordable. In a Dec. 16 ""Dear
Colleague"" letter
<http://www.foreignpolicy.com/files/fp_uploaded_documents/101217_11eana%20Dear%200olleague.pdf> , she
objected to the cost of the bill, which would be $108 million over five years, and criticized it for not providing an
accounting of how much the U.S. was already spending on this effort. The actual CB0 estimate (PDF)
<http://www.foreignpolicy.com/files/fp_uploaded_documents/101217_CB0°,1
020Estimate%20Child%20Marraige.P
DF> said the bill would authorize $108 million, but would only require $67 million in outlays from fiscal years
2011 to 2015.
Ros-Lehtinen introduced her own version of the bill, which she said would only cost $1 million. But in a fact
sheet (PDF
<http://www.foreignpolicy.comlfiles/fp_uploaded_documents/101217_Concerns%20about%20the%2ORep.pdf> ),
organizations supporting the original legislation said that Ros-Lehtinen's bill removed the implementation
procedures that gave the legislation teeth. ""Without such activities, the bill becomes merely a strategy with no
actual implementation. And without implementation of a strategy, the bill will have an extraordinarily limited
impact,"" they wrote.
Regardless, the supporters still thought the bill would pass because House Republican leadership had not
come out against it. But about one hour before the vote, every Republican House office received a message on
the bill from GOP leadership, known as a Whip Alert, saying that leadership would vote ""no"" on the bill and
encouraging all Republicans do the same. The last line on the alert particularly shocked the bill's supporters.
""There are also concerns that funding will be directed to NGOs that promote and perform abortion and
efforts to combat child marriage could be usurped as a way to overturn pro-life laws,"" the alert read.
The bill doesn't contain any funding for abortion activities and federal funding for abortion activities is
already prohibited by what's known as the ""Helms Amendment,""
<http://www.ipas.org/Publicationsiasset_upload_file418_4329.pdf> which has been boiler plate language in
appropriations bills since 1973.
Invoking the abortion issue sent the bill's supporters reeling. They believed that it was little more than a
stunt, considering that Republican pro-life senators had carefully reviewed the legislation and concluded it would
not have an impact on the abortion issue.
Rep. Stephen LaTourrette (R-OH) called out <http://www.c-
spanvideo.orgiprogram/HouseSession3981= the Republican leadership for invoking the abortion issue to defeat
the forced child marriage act in a floor speech Friday morning.
""Yesterday I was on the floor and I was a co-sponsor with [on] a piece of legislation with [Rep. Betty
McCollum (0-MN)] that would have moved money, no new money, would have moved money so that societies
that are coercing young girls into marriage.., we could make sure that they stay in school so they're not forced
i into marriage at the age of 12 and 13,"" LaTourette said. ""All of a sudden there was a fiscal argument. When that
didn't work people had to add an abortion element to it. This is a partisan place. I'm a Republican. I'm glad we
beat their butt in the election, but there comes a time when enough is enough.""
But it was too late for LaTourette and other Republicans who had fought hard for the bill, including Aaron
Schlock (R-IL). The bill is even less likely to pass next year, when the GOP will control the House and Ros-
Lehtinen will control the Foreign Affairs committee.
The main author of the bill was Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL), who was incensed when the bill
failed in the House.
""The action on the House floor stopping the Child Marriage bill tonight will endanger the lives of millions of
women and girls around the world."" Durbin said in a Thursday statement. ""These young girls, enslaved in
marriage, will be brutalized and many will die when their young bodies are torn apart while diving birth. Those
who voted to continue this barbaric practice brought shame to Capitol Hill.""
For the NGO and women's advocacy community, the implications of this defeat extend much further than
Just this bill. -ihey also saw Republicans invoke the acortion issue when objecting to the International Violence
Against Women Act and expect the new Congress to push for reinstatement of the ""Mexico City Policy,"" which
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05772091 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05772091 Date: 08/31/2015
would prevent federal funding for any organizations that even discuss abortion.
""Any time a health bill that has to do with women and girls comes to the House floor, we're going to see a
debate like the one we just saw,"" said one advocacy leader who supported the bill. ""It's hard to imagine how any
development bilis are going to pass in this environment.""
The protection of women and girls is a major focus of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who promised to
elevate the issue Thursday when rolling out the State Department's Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development
Review. She has said that forced child marriage is ""a clear and unacceptable violation of human rights"", and that
""the Department of State categorically denounces all cases of child marriage as child abuse"".
State's Ambassador at Large for Global Women's Issues Melanne Verveer has worked hard on the issue
behind the scenes. But at the eleventh hour, when the going got tough, the bill's supporters said that the
administration was nowhere to be found. In October, the White House decided to waive all penalties under the
Child Soldiers Prevention Act, another Durbin led bill that the NGO community supports.
United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) estimates that 60 million girls in developing countries now
between the ages of 20 and 24 were married before they reached 18. The Population Council, a group focused
on <http://www.popcouncil.org/> reproductive and child health, estimates that the number will increase by 100
million over the next decade if current trends continue.

Posted: 17 Dec 2010 09:57 AM PST
One of the two biggest problems identified in the Afghanistan-Pakistan Strategy Review released Thursday
(PDF <http://www.foreignpolicy.contilfileslfp_uploaded_tdocuments/101217_AfPak_overview.pdf> ) is the
Pakistani military's failure to crack down on some of the terrorist groups using Pakistan's tribal areas as a safe
haven from which to launch attacks across the border into Afghanistan.
Pakistan launched <http:fiwww.washingtonpost.comiwp-
dyn/content/article/2009110/17/AR2009101700673.ntml> a major offensive, involving approximately 30,000
troops, against extremists in South Waziristan in October 2909, and its military has also undertaken efforts to
stamp out militants in other border areas. However, the military has yet to launch offensive military operations in
; North Waziristan, where insurgent croups wreaking havoc in Afghanistan reside.
Pakistan's envoy in Washington, Ambassador Husain 1-iaggani, reacted to the report by saying that Pakistan
will engage Islamist groups in North Waziristan, including the Haqqani network (no relation), but only when there
• is sufficient support in all areas of Pakistan's government for the effort, and not until they are confident that the
mission can be completed effectively.
""Pakistan has made it very clear that we are fighting terrorists because they are a threat to our own
existence as a modern democratic nation. We will fight all groups in all parts of our country,"" Haqqani said in an
exclusive interview with The Cable. ""But we will follow,tii-nelines that suit our own capabilities and can lead to
success.""
Haqqani said that the Pakistani army, which has taken the fight to six out of the seven regions inside
Pakistan in which domestic militant groups operate and suffered thousands of casualties in the process, is simply
not in a position to expand its war on the extremists now.
""Right now, it's only a question of operational capability and readiness. Our armed forces have been
engaged in dealing with flood relief work,"" he said. ""We have to see what resources we will allocate in which part
of the country, and those rather than any political factors are responsible for any waiting period.""
He also noted that ""there is a fragile consensus in Pakistan in favor of military action against regional
elements,"" and that Pakistan's government has no choice but to make the decision to attack North Waziristan
groups on a timeline that prioritized Pakistani considerations over American ones.

""Sometimes it's easy for our allies to tell us what to do and for us to tell our allies what to do. But everyone
makes decisions based on their own perceptions and analysis of on ground realities,"" Haqqani said.
In several discussions with other Pakistani officials, an even more complicated picture of the Pakistani
position on attacking groups in North Waziristan emerges. The Pakistanis largely believe that the U.S.
government is being unrealistic in terms of the timelines it wants for cracking down on terrorist safe havens along
the Afghanistan-Pakistan border, which have existed for decades.
""There will always be a gap between our two countries because the Americans want things done quickly
and done their way,"" another Pakistani government official said.
A third senior Pakistani official said that many Pakistanis feel that the Obama administration is placing too
much of the blame on Pakistan for the lack of progress in the U.S.-led war in Afghanistan.
""The U.S. keeps telling Pakistan to do more, but Pakistan keeps telling the U.S. to do more on certain
questions such as speeding up building up of Afghan army, establishing a real process toward reconciliation, and
providing Pakistan the means for large scale operations,"" the official said.
The United States has provided Pakistan with several billions of dollars in military and economic aid to
support its war against domestic insurgents. But many in the Pakistani government have criticized what they say
characterize as the slow arrival of these funds, which they say are in any case too small to address Pakistan's
severe problems.
""It's very simplistic to measure success in amount of assistance provided to Pakistan,"" one Pakistani official
said.
In remarks delivered during the rollout of the strategy review Thursday, President Obama was diplomatic
when discussing his administration's ongoing drive to push Pakistan to do more in North Waziristan.
""increasingly, the Pakistani government recognizes that terrorist networks in its border regions are a threat
to all our countries, especially Pakistan. We've welcomed maor Pakistani offensives in the tribal regions. We will
continue to help strengthen Pakistanis' capacity to root out terrorists,"" said Obama. ""Nevertheless, progress has
not come fast enough. So we will continue to insist to Pakistani leaders that terrorist safe havens within their
borders must be dealt with.""
Undersecretary of Defense for Policy Michele Flournoy acknowledged in an interview
<http://www.jcs.milinewsarticie.aspx?ida,479> the same day that there was more work to be done on the
relationship before the Pakistanis were willing to fully support the U.S. and NATO-led mission in Afghanistan.
""Given the ups and downs of our historical relationship with Pakistan, they fear our abandonment,"" she said.
""Their calculus is very much affected by the long-term commitment they feel from us and in working in a strategic
partnership.""
The White House recognizes that its efforts have fallen short so far. ""The bottom line is that Pakistan is a
country where we have little influence, little access and little credibility."" one of °dame's aides told
<http://www. nytimes.com/2010/12/17iworldiasia/17sanger html?scp=2&sq=pakistan&st=cse> The New York
Times.
The administration's official line, therefore, is to agree with the Pakistani government and express sensitivity
to its claim that they simply can't expand their war against extremists at this time.
""We would like them to move tomorrow, we would like them to take out these people tomorrow,"" said
<http://www.reuters.corn/articlelidUSTRE6BG1JN20101217> the new U.S. Ambassador to Pakistan Cameron
Munter. ""But we understand they're telling us honestly about the capacity of their military, and when they are
able, we are convinced they will move in.""
But for many in 'Washington, the open-ended delay in Pakistan's promise to expand military operations into
North Waziristan represents a strategic choice, and is not just a result of the military's operational ;imitations. But
; whatever Pakistan's reasons, the delay doesn't inspire confidence that the Obama administration can meet its
timelines for making progress in Afghanistan.

Congress to honor Holbrooke
<http://feed proxy.google.comi—r/foreignpolicy/thecable/-310P9OsfZEoDY/congress_to_honor_holbrooke?utm_so
urce=feedburner&utm_medium=email>
Posted: 17 Dec 2010 04:42 AM PST
In a rare instance of bipartisanship, the House of Representatives moved to pass a resolution Friday
honoring the life and work of the recently departed Ambassador Richard Holbrooke.
The resolution (H.Con.Res 335 <http://thomas.ioc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c111:H.+Con.+Res.+335:> ) was
sponsored by outgoing House Appropriations State and Foreign Ops Subcommittee chairwoman Nita Lowey (D-
NY); and cosponsored by incoming House Foreign Affairs chairwoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-FL), Howard
Berman (D-CA), and Mike Turner (R-OH). The bill is ""a concurrent resolution honoring the exceptional
achievements of Ambassador Richard Holbrooke and recognizing the significant contributions he has made to
United States national security, humanitarian causes and peaceful resolutions of international conflict.""
""The passing of Ambassador Holbrooke on Monday, December 13th, is a great loss for the American
people,"" Lowey said in a statement. ""One of our nation's most talented diplomats, Richard Holbrooke possessed
a fierce determination and unsurpassed brilliance in advocating for American security, diplomatic, and
development interests around the world - in Southeast Asia and post-Cold War Europe, at the United Nations,
and most recently in /Afghanistan and Pakistan. His exceptional accomplishments as a peace-maker, diplomat,
writer, scholar, manager and mentor will define his legacy as one of the true great foreign policy giants of our
time.""
Ros-Lehtinen praised Holbrooke as ""one of the most consequential world diplomats of the last half-century,""
and said that ""his tireless work in pursuit of United States national interests and international peace have put us
all in his debt.""
After praising his career -- which included two stints as assistant secretary of state, peace negotiator in the
Balkans, U.S. ambassador to the U.N., and service as U.S. special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan -
- Ros-Lehtinen called for reform of the United Nations and protection of Israel within its bodies.
""In New York at the UN, [Holbrooke] did much of the heavy lifting on Congressionally-led efforts to rein in
UN spending, to make more equitable the dues paid by the United States, and to improve the standing of Israel
in that multinational body,"" she said. ""Sadly. those concerns have returned with a renewed urgency -- with the
need for fundamental reform of UN budget and the virulently anti-Israel UN Human Rights Council -- and the
Congress can only hope to have such a tenacious, principled partner in the future.""

Philippe,
The right response to Wikileaks
Tuesday, November 30, 2010
MANY OF the State Department documents released so far by WikiLeaks are embarrassing to their authors or subjects,
but otherwise harmless. Some might even be helpful: Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was among those
fuming Monday at the news that most of the Arab states surrounding Iran might welcome a U.S. attack on his country.
Still, there is little doubt that the release of the cables will damage the State Department and its diplomacy. Sensitive
relations with countries such as Yemen, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia might be impaired; foreign leaders everywhere may
consider carefully, at least for a while, before speaking frankly to U.S. diplomats.
Some in Washington are calling on the Obama administration to respond to the leak with drastic measures, such as a
cyberattack on the WikiLeaks Internet site or the prosecution of its Australian-born leader, Julian Assange. That would
be an overreaction. There is apparently no top-secret material in the WikiLeaks documents; the U.S. cyberwar capacity
should not be deployed for less-than-critical interests. Mr. Assangels arrest and prosecution would turn a man now
widely perceived as a self-promoting sex crimes suspect into an international martyr.
There is a much more immediate and sensible task for Congress and the administration - starting with the Defense
Department. That is to thoroughly plumb how a 22-year-old Army private at a remote Iraqi base could have gotten
access to 250,000 State Department cables, as well as tens of thousands more military reports from Iraq and
Afghanistan, and how he could have downloaded them onto CDs without being detected. The chief suspect in the
deliveries to WikiLeaks, Bradley Manning, was a disconsolate man who had been reprimanded for assaulting an officer
and believed he might be discharged for his misconduct. Why was he allowed to retain access to classified information?
How could he have stolen such a large amount of material without triggering any alarms?
The Pentagon announced several procedural changes on Sunday in reaction to Pfc. Manning's alleged actions, including
the disabling of the capacity to copy classified material onto portable devices and limits on the transfer of material from
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05772089 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05772089 Date: 08/31/2015
classified to unclassified computer systems. Still, these changes come too late - it's notable that at the State Department
itself, the downloading Mr. Manning allegedly carried out would not.have been possible. What's needed is a thorough
review of why the Defense Department failed to adopt simple security procedures, how it managed Pfc. Manning, and
whether the announced reforms are adequate.
Also needed is a broader government review of whether the distribution of classified information has gone too far. Of
course there must not be firewalls that prevent senior intelligence analysts and their bosses from seeing and sharing
sensitive information. That does not mean a troubled 22-year-old in Baghdad should have access to secret State
Department cables from all over the world. Surely there is a way to create a system that can do the former while
preventing the latter.

The expression ""do more"" repeated incessantly in today's press is essentially a negative characterization of the
Secretary's position. In general, it is code for ""After so much cost and so many losses and so many bombs in our cities,
the Americans are telling us we're still not doing enough."" This negative interpretation is used by the PakMil to convince
Pakistanis that the U.S. is a malign influence and to avoid taking the steps we seek.
When you brief her this morning suggest the following:
We avoid literally using the words ""do more;"" but
Do not hesitate to specify what we want them to do; and
Let's push back on this view: We acknowledge their contributions and their losses — and we are helping. We-
would never ask Pakistan to do more alone —we are doing more, too, including supporting Pakistan militarily
and economically. Freedom requires constant vigilance and democracy is never ""done.""

Colleagues:
Further to our earlier alert, the press is widely reporting Somali gunmen disguised in army uniforms stormed a hotel
popular with government officials on Tuesday, and a legislator said at least 15 parliamentarians were killed. There was
no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack.
The African Union confirmed at least 15 people were killed in the attack on the Huna Hotel, in a government-controlled
neighborhood between the presidential palace and the Indian Ocean. It did not say whether the dead were all MPs.
Embassy Nairobi spoke with President Sheikh Sharif who confirmed that seven MPs are now dead and numerous others

uniforms. At least two blew themselves up.

5843,C05771036,MIDDLE EAST,HRC,,,Middle East,HRC,Sandy,"Congratulations on the resumption of direct talks. As evidenced by your activity over the
past several weeks your involvement in the peace process inevitably has deepened as the
need for high-level U.S. intervention has grown. I believe that is a positive result. But
the more fundamental issue remains what your role can and should be going forward in
order to maximize chances of diplomatic success.
I. . State of Play
As the U.S. embarks on the next stage in the Israeli-Palestinian process, it faces a series
of tactical and strategic challenges regarding policy, politics and personality.
1. At a policy level, the meager results of indirect talks and difficulties in transitioning to
direct talks have underscored the lack of trust between the two sides as well as
existing substantive gaps. With direct talks begin in the coming days, one obstacles
will have been removed, but several remain. Some or all of these may have been
resolved in connection with gaining agreement to direct talks.
a. How to handle the renewal or non-renewal of Israel's settlement moratorium?
b. What is the goal of the direct talks and is there a consensus on this matter
between the parties? A comprehensive agreement on permanent (CAPS) that
covers all the details? A framework agreement on permanent status (FAPS)
that outlines the governing parameters, along the lines of the 2000 Clinton
parameters? Or, less ambitiously, a short (one or two page) statement of
principles?
c. What role will the U.S. play? Will George or another U.S. official be present
in all meetings? Will Netanyahu accept that? Is there an argument for
allowing the two sides to deal with one another without any intermediary, at
least for a while, so that they do not seek to play to the U.S.?
d. What will the U.S. do in the event of an impasse or breakdown? Should it
present bridging proposals and, if so, when?
e. How much work should be done, in parallel and simultaneously with the
direct talks, between the U.S. and the Palestinians on the one hand and the
U.S. and Israel on the other?
Beyond those questions, I am persuaded the most important factor is and is likely to
remain what Netanyahu is prepared to do. You have witnessed first-hand how
difficult it can be to deal with the Palestinians and the Arab world more generally;
how fragile is Abbas's political position; how indecisive they can be. Still, at bottom,
we have a relatively clear sense of their positions on the core issues should we ever
reach a moment of truth. That is not the case with Netanyahu who either does not
know himself or is not prepared to share and who, until now, has neither felt the
urgency to reach a deal nor the discomfort of the status quo.
Assuming Bibi can be convinced of the benefits of a deal along lines acceptable to the
Palestinians, this will not occur solely on the basis of his talks with Abbas, whom he
likes but does not truly respect and who he fears will not be in a position to deliver.
Rather, it will happen only if he feels that (1) it is under the leadership of a U.S.
administration he genuinely trusts; (2) he is convinced that the combination of the
agreement and U.S. assurances meets his core needs in terms of Israeli security and
international recognition of its Jewish character; and (3) he feels that, again with U.S.
help, he can sell it to his people and survive -- or even thrive -- politically.
Getting Bibi to accept the core compromises will not be enough, of course. Other
basic elements of the strategy must involve reaching out effectively to the Israeli
public and ensuring strong, vocal Arab support for a U.S.- sponsored deal without
which Abbas cannot say yes and Israelis will lack the incentive to do so. But the
point is that a prerequisite for a successful peace effort is for the U.S. to convince the
prime minister -- through various forms of overt persuasion and implicit pressure -- to
make the necessary compromises. At the end of the day, if Bibi is to make a deal, it
will be a deal with the U.S. as much as with the Palestinians.
2. At a political level, the past year has clearly demonstrated the degree to which the
U.S. has been hamstrung by its low ratings in Israel and among important segments of
the domestic Jewish constituency. This is a critical dimension not for electoral
reasons, but because the U.S.'s best chance of influencing Bibi is to build support for
a deal in Israel and at home among those who care most. That capacity has been
improved to some extent as a result of the successful July visit by Netanyahu and the
string of military/security deals between our two countries. But we must be honest:
there sill is a long way to go. If anything, the recent Obama/Bibi illustrated a new,
potentially perverse dynamic: the U.S. president at this juncture needs the Israeli
prime minister to validate his pro-Israeli credentials more than the Israeli prime
minister needs the U.S. president to vouch for his pro-peace ones.
3. At the level of personalities, George, with all his skill and perseverance, cannot by
himself secure serious concessions from the parties by himself. In recent discussions,
both Israelis and Palestinians described him as someone they respected but to whom
they would not make major concessions. This is the curse of the day-to-day
negotiator. When they are ready to deal, they will only deal with the players they
perceive with authority. It was not different for Dennis during the Clinton
Administration. This does not mean that Mitchell does not have a crucial role going
forward. Indeed, he can be empowered by your more active involvement.
The president faces a different but no less difficult problem. He is not trusted in
Israel and, though the July meeting might have altered the situation somewhat, not
trusted by Bibi. Domestically, he faces a reservoir of skepticism on this issue which
reflects many factors, including inexcusable prejudice, but which could obstruct his
effectiveness both as an interlocutor and as a salesman. Besides, as we learned during
WJC's presidency, it would be a mistake for Obama to get too deeply invested in
negotiations prior to the end-point; he does not have the time and should not expend
the political capital prematurely. To do so, moreover, would automatically be to
devalue the role of anyone beneath him, thus making the peace process as a whole
excessively dependent on his involvement.
Your Role
Under these circumstances, in my view, your deeper involvement is both essential and
potentially highly beneficial. It should be a selective involvement; Mitchell still must be
the day-to-day negotiator and others also must play a part. In particular, I would not
recommend you get overly mired in the details of the direct talks or the set of questions I
described above (about their format, goal, U.S. role, etc) other than at critical junctures.
Nor would I advise you to get pulled into a Christopher-style shuttle diplomacy which
would quickly depreciate your value.
Rather, by injecting yourself strategically at the right time and in the right way, you could
fill the gaps identified above. This is because you are uniquely placed to address the
need both for a higher-level mediator and for someone who enjoys considerable
credibility in Israel and the U.S. (Bibi reportedly told someone recently he was prepared
to deal substantively with Obama and with you).
Your role would be twofold
1. To serve as the higher-level interlocutor on matters offinal status. To a large
degree, Abbas's positions are already known; they will have to be further explored
and he will have to be pushed, and you should engage him. But we probably know
his zone of possible agreement. Not so with Bibi and, I believe, you are ideally suited
to begin a series of in-depth conversations aimed at understanding his key concerns,
how they can be met, what he would need from us and others, and how far, at the end
of the day, he is prepared to go with the Palestinians if his security and other needs
are met. Bibi knows and trusts you; in fact, you are almost certainly the high-level
U.S. official he trusts most. If you succeed in taking him into your confidence and
work with him over time, you could pave the way for an Israeli-U.S. understanding
that would underpin an Israeli-Palestinian agreement. At times, this will require
being tough and pushing back against some of his most extreme demands (the
militarily questionable request for a very long term Israeli presence in the Jordan
Valley being one of them) and proposing more rational alternatives. But the point is
that without getting Bibi to trust and level with us, without him feeling both what he
has to lose but also what he has to gain, this process is unlikely to go anywhere.
To repeat, this should not be at Mitchell's expense. It should be a parallel,
reinforcing process in which you would deal one-on-one with Abbas and Netanyahu
at periodic intervals, for extensive periods of time.
2. To help restore the US. 's image and credibility in Israel and among important
domestic constituencies. You have the history, background and credentials to do so
here and in Israel and thus to overcome some of the suspicion with which Obama
must contend. Over time, through a series of visits and public statements, you would
seek to make the case for a peace agreement in positive terms, focusing on what
benefits it would bring to Israelis rather than on the costs they would incur: secure
and recognized borders; stronger security ties to the U.S. and others; an end to the
conflict; normal relations with the Arab world; and strengthened international
legitimacy.
III. Potential Downsides and Responses
1. Dragging you into the weeds of negotiations. A risk exists that, though repeated
meetings with Bibi and Abbas, you will be drawn into detailed discussions over the
nature of the territorial compromise, the precise security arrangements, etc. This
would be unhelpful both to the process and to you. There is a fine line between
discussing the principles that should guide the final outcome and the precise details of
that outcome, but it will be important not to cross it. Your role should be to extract
from Bibi important understandings and parameters (e.g., security arrangements on
the Jordan valley that minimize infringements on Palestinian sovereignty and
minimize the duration of any residual Israeli presence) and then have your respective
negotiators work out the details
2. Disempowering George. A related danger is to render George powerless by creating
the sense that everything can and should be dealt with through you. Besides
potentially leading him to step down, this outcome would not serve your interests for
the reasons just cited, your effectiveness being a function of your remaining
somewhat removed from the day-to-day specifics of the talks. In fact, as I see it, this
process could and should end up strengthening George's presently hand by clarifying
it. Once you and Bibi will have reached agreement on broad principles, the two of
you will provide instructions to your respective negotiators to find solutions that
reflect them. In that sense, both George and his counterpart will have a stronger and
clearer mandate than currently is the case.
3. Involving you in a failed enterprise. Of all the potential downsides, this is the most
significant one and ought not to be dismissed lightly. Failure is a real possibility.
Palestinians are in disarray. The Arab world is profoundly divided, with forthcoming
successions in Egypt and Saudi Arabia that will weaken two of the states upon which
we most rely. And a serious questionmark hovers over Bibi's politics, his head and
his heart. As a result, a powerful argument could be made that you would be better
off keeping at arms' length from this process, especially given how much else is on
your plate. That said, I disagree for the following reasons:
a. By not getting involved, you risk the worst of two worlds: being associated
with a failure (which, by virtue of your position, you inevitably would be) and
being criticized for not having been engaged in an effort to avert it.
b. Over the past year and a half, you have been involved -- traveling to the
region; seeking to convince Abbas to enter into talks; commenting on the
settlement freeze in Jerusalem -- and you will not be able to escape that kind
of involvement in the future. The problem is that your engagement has
appeared to be sporadic rather than strategic -- that you've been deployed
when it has been deemed necessary to get out of an impasse rather than in
order to implement a long term, well thought-out plan. I do not think that has
served you well.
c. While one cannot by any means be confident of success, I believe an
agreement is possible but that it only has a chance if we can work effectively
to bring Bibi into a position where he believes that the costs of a historical
compromise are outweighed by its benefits.
d. If we don't try all we can over the next year or year and a half, you will in all
likelihood be forced to deal extensively with the Middle East -- albeit not in a
peacemaking but in a crisis-managing mode. Without movement on the
peace process, Abbas could depart, Fayyad's state-building plan could be gone
in smoke, hostilities might break out between Israel, Syria and Hizbollah and
the U.S. would have to deal with Iran in an even less hospitable regional
climate.","RELEASE IN FULL

Under these circumstances, in my view, your deeper involvement is both essential and
potentially highly beneficial. It should be a selective involvement; Mitchell still must be
the day-to-day negotiator and others also must play a part. In particular, I would not
recommend you get overly mired in the details of the direct talks or the set of questions I
described above (about their format, goal, U.S. role, etc) other than at critical junctures.
Nor would I advise you to get pulled into a Christopher-style shuttle diplomacy which
would quickly depreciate your value.
Rather, by injecting yourself strategically at the right time and in the right way, you could
fill the gaps identified above. This is because you are uniquely placed to address the
need both for a higher-level mediator and for someone who enjoys considerable
credibility in Israel and the U.S. (Bibi reportedly told someone recently he was prepared
to deal substantively with Obama and with you).
Your role would be twofold
1. To serve as the higher-level interlocutor on matters offinal status. To a large
degree, Abbas's positions are already known; they will have to be further explored
and he will have to be pushed, and you should engage him. But we probably know
his zone of possible agreement. Not so with Bibi and, I believe, you are ideally suited
to begin a series of in-depth conversations aimed at understanding his key concerns,
how they can be met, what he would need from us and others, and how far, at the end
of the day, he is prepared to go with the Palestinians if his security and other needs
are met. Bibi knows and trusts you; in fact, you are almost certainly the high-level
U.S. official he trusts most. If you succeed in taking him into your confidence and
work with him over time, you could pave the way for an Israeli-U.S. understanding
that would underpin an Israeli-Palestinian agreement. At times, this will require
being tough and pushing back against some of his most extreme demands (the
militarily questionable request for a very long term Israeli presence in the Jordan
Valley being one of them) and proposing more rational alternatives. But the point is
that without getting Bibi to trust and level with us, without him feeling both what he
has to lose but also what he has to gain, this process is unlikely to go anywhere.
To repeat, this should not be at Mitchell's expense. It should be a parallel,
reinforcing process in which you would deal one-on-one with Abbas and Netanyahu
at periodic intervals, for extensive periods of time.
2. To help restore the US. 's image and credibility in Israel and among important
domestic constituencies. You have the history, background and credentials to do so
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05771036 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05771036 Date: 08/31/2015
here and in Israel and thus to overcome some of the suspicion with which Obama
must contend. Over time, through a series of visits and public statements, you would
seek to make the case for a peace agreement in positive terms, focusing on what
benefits it would bring to Israelis rather than on the costs they would incur: secure
and recognized borders; stronger security ties to the U.S. and others; an end to the
conflict; normal relations with the Arab world; and strengthened international
legitimacy.
III. Potential Downsides and Responses
1. Dragging you into the weeds of negotiations. A risk exists that, though repeated
meetings with Bibi and Abbas, you will be drawn into detailed discussions over the
nature of the territorial compromise, the precise security arrangements, etc. This
would be unhelpful both to the process and to you. There is a fine line between
discussing the principles that should guide the final outcome and the precise details of
that outcome, but it will be important not to cross it. Your role should be to extract
from Bibi important understandings and parameters (e.g., security arrangements on
the Jordan valley that minimize infringements on Palestinian sovereignty and
minimize the duration of any residual Israeli presence) and then have your respective
negotiators work out the details
2. Disempowering George. A related danger is to render George powerless by creating
the sense that everything can and should be dealt with through you. Besides
potentially leading him to step down, this outcome would not serve your interests for
the reasons just cited, your effectiveness being a function of your remaining
somewhat removed from the day-to-day specifics of the talks. In fact, as I see it, this
process could and should end up strengthening George's presently hand by clarifying
it. Once you and Bibi will have reached agreement on broad principles, the two of
you will provide instructions to your respective negotiators to find solutions that
reflect them. In that sense, both George and his counterpart will have a stronger and
clearer mandate than currently is the case.
3. Involving you in a failed enterprise. Of all the potential downsides, this is the most
significant one and ought not to be dismissed lightly. Failure is a real possibility.
Palestinians are in disarray. The Arab world is profoundly divided, with forthcoming
successions in Egypt and Saudi Arabia that will weaken two of the states upon which
we most rely. And a serious questionmark hovers over Bibi's politics, his head and
his heart. As a result, a powerful argument could be made that you would be better
off keeping at arms' length from this process, especially given how much else is on
your plate. That said, I disagree for the following reasons:
a. By not getting involved, you risk the worst of two worlds: being associated
with a failure (which, by virtue of your position, you inevitably would be) and
being criticized for not having been engaged in an effort to avert it.
b. Over the past year and a half, you have been involved -- traveling to the
region; seeking to convince Abbas to enter into talks; commenting on the
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05771036 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05771036 Date: 08/31/2015
settlement freeze in Jerusalem -- and you will not be able to escape that kind
of involvement in the future. The problem is that your engagement has
appeared to be sporadic rather than strategic -- that you've been deployed
when it has been deemed necessary to get out of an impasse rather than in
order to implement a long term, well thought-out plan. I do not think that has
served you well.
c. While one cannot by any means be confident of success, I believe an
agreement is possible but that it only has a chance if we can work effectively
to bring Bibi into a position where he believes that the costs of a historical
compromise are outweighed by its benefits.
d. If we don't try all we can over the next year or year and a half, you will in all
likelihood be forced to deal extensively with the Middle East -- albeit not in a
peacemaking but in a crisis-managing mode. Without movement on the
peace process, Abbas could depart, Fayyad's state-building plan could be gone
in smoke, hostilities might break out between Israel, Syria and Hizbollah and
the U.S. would have to deal with Iran in an even less hospitable regional
climate.

Re: Sunday, State of Play
Clegg is still in talks with Cameron. About 1,500 Liberal Democrats spontaneously protested at
Lib-Dern headquarters against a deal with the Tories given their policies, especially on Europe.
But Clegg remains in negotiations. He seems quite intent on working it out with Cameron, it
appears. His inner Tory magnetically draws him to his heritage. Clegg has also misplayed almost
every turn, presented with big chances and blowing them through a combination of inexperience
(derived partly from heading a party out of power for nearly 100 years) and inbred arrogance
(from no less a privileged background than Cameron, though seeming less snobbish because he
went to Westminster instead of Eton and has a less pronounced upper-class accent, more neutral,
because of his more cosmopolitan roots through his family).
What about Labour? Shaun and a couple of others have rounded up about 29 votes from other
parties (Scottish National Party, NI parties, Welsh party) that could be part of a grand
progressive once-in-a-lifetime coalition that required the LDs. Gordon has said he will allow
Clegg-Cameron discussions to play out and a general offer to Clegg is on the table, its terms
giving far more on a referendum and policy than the Tories. Behind the scenes, Labour is putting
whatever harsh pressure it can on LD leaders. Peter is playing a cynical double game. He is a
sectarian in a sect of one. Yet Gordon for strange psychological reasons rooted in his triangle
with Tony and Peter relies on Peter. Peter, according to Shaun, has wrung a pledge from Borwn
that if Brown emerges from this crisis he, Peter, will replace David as Foreign Secretary.
Meanwhile, Peter has advised David to sideline himself. David has done so instead of being
forward as a strong party man behind Brown in dire straits. Standing back only makes David
look ambitious, waiting for Brown to lose and aiming to a leadership contest afterward, when
Peter, as he has promised, would guide David to the prize. The plot thickens: Ed Miliband,
David's younger brother, the environment secretary, will run for leader against his brother if
Brown loses. Ed has more of a common touch. The outcome of that contest would be more than
uncertain. But before that eventuality Gordon's team reaches out to the LDs in private. Yet
Shaun's attitude, as I read it, leans toward pessmism. A London Times polls just out says 62
percent want Gordon out. Where were the fickle voters in the election? The poll shows more
than discontent with Gordon, but also how people are being whipped by the Murdoch media.

What about the Tories? A secret memo from William Hague to Cameron written before the
election was leaked this morning to The Observer (the Sunday paper of The Guardian), proposes
an anti-Europe line of the new government. (I've enclosed the article below.) The atmosphere
inside the Conservatives is acrid and anxious. But Lord Ashcroft, the Tory moneyman, who
spent five million pounds alone In marginal districts, is furious that Cameron failed to win
outright, failed in his campaign, made a foolish decision to include Clegg in the debates, etc.
Many agree with the evil Ashcroft. But the finger pointing won't matter if a deal works with
Clegg. The Conservative strategy would be to coopt Clegg now, do whatever deal can be done,
maintain a more or less center-right but moderated government for about a year, call a new
election, win outright on the momentum of the recovery engineered by Brown but claimed by
Tories as proof that the change was responsible, jettison Clegg and the LDs, and govern from the
radical right as the children of Thatcher for five years. The Tories would then move on their
electoral reforms: cutting the number of seats in Parliament, redistricting in Conservative favor,
and trying to outlaw union contributions to the Labour Party.
What about the LDs? Clegg's deal with the Tories would of course thwart any Lib-Lab coalition,
probably the only chance for a grand progressive alliance that would keep the Tories out of
power forever. Clegg's personal instincts obviously lean toward the Tories, having little to do
with policy. The party's leaders may be opposed, but they are also likely to be feckless and weak
as they always have been.
So, whatever the case, I would doubt you'll see David again as Foreign Secretary. Prepare for
hauge, who is deeply anti-European and will be disingenuous with you. Tory budget cuts in NI,
already announced, would cause havoc with peace and economic recovery. I'd send a private
message asap on that score the second a new government is announced, if it is. Tilt publicly to
Merkel on Europe for this reason among others.

Tory-Lib Dem coalition threatened by secret
hardline memo on Europe
•Draft letter by William Hague sets out tough stance on EU
•Leak follows leaders""constructive, amicable' meeting
Toby Helm and Anushka Asthana
• The Observer, Sunday 9 May 2010
David Cameron's hopes of forming a coalition with the Liberal Democrats were dramatically
undermined last night by the leaking of a top-secret letter outlining the hardline Eurosceptic
stance he and William Hague planned to adopt in government.
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770244 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770244 Date: 08/31/2015
The document, obtained by the Observer, is headed ""draft letter from Foreign Secretary to Prime
Minister"" and was written last week. It assumed an outright Tory victory and spelt out how
Hague intended to adopt a tough approach to Europe at a meeting of EU foreign ministers in
Brussels tomorrow.
In the letter, compiled by civil servants but written in the first person, Hague tells Cameron how
his message would be that ""the British relationship with the EU has changed with our election""
to one firmly against any further integration.
Exposing the massive gulf between Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg and the Conservative
leadership on Europe, Hague says he would demand the right to repatriate powers over criminal
justice as well as social and employment policy during the first term of a Tory government —
demands many EU leaders say they would resist.
Hague planned to tell his EU counterparts: ""Rest assured that we seek engagement, not
confrontation. But our aim is to achieve these commitments during this parliament."" He would
also tell his first foreign ministers' meeting ""we will never join the euro"" and conclude: ""You will
find us firm but fair, playing a leading role, fighting our corner, practical and straight-talking.""
Last night the Tories said they had no knowledge of the letter. But the Observer understands it
was drawn up on the basis of detailed briefings between senior civil servants and Hague. The
document came to light as Clegg, a strong pro-European, yesterday met his MPs and senior party
figures to discuss a possible coalition with the Tories, who emerged from Thursday's general
election with the largest number of seats but short of an overall majority.
Cameron and Clegg held face-to-face talks late yesterday as they continued their attempts to
thrash out a power-sharing deal. A senior Conservative party spokeswoman said the talks were
""constructive and amicable"". The 70-minute meeting took place at Admiralty House in
Whitehall. A Lib Dem spokesman also described the discussions as ""constructive and amicable"".
Tory and Lib Dem sources said last night that discussions would not conclude until the
beginning of the coming week at the earliest. An emergency meeting of the 1922 committee of
Tory backbenchers will be held tomorrow to discuss the possible coalition. Today, Hague, Oliver
Letwin and George Osborne will resume talks with the Lib Dems' Vince Cable, Chris Huhne and
David Laws.
But the stark language used in the letter is bound to alarm Clegg, who has been savage in his
criticism of the Conservatives' attitude to Europe which he believes is rooted in the past and will
limit Britain's ability to fight cross-border crime and meet the environmental challenges of the
21st century.
The document will also be seen by Lib Dem MPs and the party's rank and file as evidence that
their pro-Europeanism would be compromised by linking up with the Tories. A Lib Dem
spokesman said the party was strongly pro-European, but would not be drawn on the document.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770244 Date: 08/31/2015
Yesterday Cameron came under pressure from senior figures in his own party not to give in to
Clegg's demands by watering down Conservative manifesto commitments. Shadow defence
secretary Liam Fox warned that a Tory government could not be ""held to ransom"" by Lib Dems
demanding proportional representation.
Clegg may also face opposition from within his party to any attempt to form a coalition with the
Tories, particularly on economic issues.
Yesterday the Social Liberal Forum, which represents left-leaning Lib Dems and includes a third
of the party's MPs, issued a set of ""red lines"" which it said the party must not cross, including
any measure that would increase the gap between the rich and poor — ruling out supporting the
Tory pledge to cut inheritance tax. Three other red lines were any suggestion of cuts to frontline
services in the current financial year, any worsening treatment of asylum seekers and any
watering-down of the human rights act.
Meanwhile, Gordon Brown and his closest advisers were working on how to expand their
counter-offer to the Lib Dems, including a referendum on changes to the voting system. Senior
officials said Labour was planning to draw up a formal ""coalition contract"" — as happens in
Germany — that would bind the Lib Dems and other smaller parties into a deal if the Tory
discussions with the Lib Dems were to fail.
Most Labour ministers now believe Brown would have to step down before Clegg would
consider a pact, though senior government insiders insisted this was not being discussed as an
option.
One re-elected Labour MP, John Mann, of Bassetlaw, called on Brown to step down as Labour
leader, claiming that the party would have influence on the outcome of the current negotiations
only if Brown agreed to give up the leadership.
""Brown should not lead Labour into any future election and he should stand down before the
next Labour party conference,"" he said. ""Gordon Brown's continuation as leader rules out the
credibility of a Lib-Lab pact that has to prioritise the modernisation and reform of the antiquated
UK political systems.""

STATEMENT BY SECRETARY CLINTON
Conflict Minerals in the Democratic Republic of Congo
Last year in the Democratic Republic of Congo, I spoke out against the trade in ""conflict minerals"" that has
funded a cycle of conflict there that has left more than 5 million people dead since 1998, displaced countless
more, and spawned an epidemic of sexual and gender-based violence.
President Obama has now signed into law a measure that will require corporations to publicly disclose what
they are doing to ensure that their products don't contain these minerals. The DRC has formally expressed its
support for this law and has thanked both the executive and legislative branches of our government. This is one
of several steps we are taking to stop this illicit and deadly trade.
After my visit to the Congo, I directed the State Department to develop a holistic strategy on this issue as part of
our broader effort to engage effectively with the DRC. We continue to work with the government to crack
down on corruption, both bilaterally and through the Great Lakes Contact Group. At the United Nations
Security Council, we successfully pushed to expand the listing criteria in the DRC Sanctions Committee to
include those supporting illegal armed groups through illicit trade of natural resources. We have provided
support for initiatives on certification and due diligence that have been initiated by the government of the DRC,
local and foreign industry groups, and regional and international institutions. And we have met with a wide

Subject: (AP) Oman: No plans to free two other Americans in Iran
MUSCAT (AP) - Oman's foreign minister says he's not aware of any current plans for Iran to release two other Americans
still being held there but that his country is willing to act as an intermediary between Tehran and Washington. Oman
played a key role in helping mediate the release of American Sarah Shourd from Iran. Two other Americans with whom
she was arrested last year are still being held in Tehran on espionage charges. Oman's foreign minister, Yusuf bin Alawai
bin Abdullah, said by phone that there are ""great possibilities"" in repairing relations between the United States and
Iran. To help restore ties, he urged American officials to tone down what is seen as harsh rhetoric directed at Iran.

5596,C05770483,CORKER,H,,2010-07-16T04:00:00+00:00,Corker,,"Verma, Richard R <VermaRR@state.gov>","And pasted below is the exchange between Corker and Holbrooke:
CORKER:
Mr. Chairman, thank you.
I want to thank the ambassador for coming. I know he has a wealth of knowledge and certainly served our country for
many years.
A number of us wrote a letter to you asking for this hearing, and my guess is you might have had hearings any way.
But the reason we wrote the letter -- bipartisan letter -- was to provide Congress and the American people with a
definition of the end state for our civilian operations in Afghanistan, clear objectives for the civilian mission, and a
detailed plan for achieving those objectives, and the very specific, measurable metrics being used to measure progress
towards achieving those objectives.
I have to say, I've been here for an hour and 10 minutes. I have heard nothing -- nothing -- about that. And while I
respect the ambassador, I've heard a lot of process. I've heard a lot about meetings. I have no earthly idea -- no earthly
idea what our objectives are on the civilian front.
And I don't know if you have time to begin doing that right now, but this has so far been an incredible waste of time,
from the standpoint of -- of hearing, though.
And I have tremendous respect for you, but maybe we have the wrong witness. I hope we'll have maybe Secretary
Clinton and Eikenberry, maybe Crocker. I know he's supposed to come.
But could you answer the question that was the purpose of these hearings in the first place?
HOLBROOKE:
I'm sorry. You don't feel that I've told you what our civilian programs are?
CORKER:
You've told me a lot of process. I'd like to know a definition of what our end state is for civilian operations, the very
question we asked when we set this hearing up, is in Afghanistan, clear objectives for the -- for the -- detailed plan for
achieving those. I'd like to hear you talk about that.
I mean, I'm glad we have a lot of interagency folks here, but I'm not hearing anything that talks about where we're
going.
I'd also like to know how the withdrawal date that's been set affects that and how it affects those we're working with
in the country.
HOLBROOKE:
First of all, Senator Corker, I believe I have discussed our civilian programs in very considerable detail within the
constraints of time, but we did prepare a report for this committee earlier this year, which was entered into the record
and which I will be happy to enter into the record again, if you wish. And you can go through every one of the programs.
The reason I brought my colleagues with me was to show that this was a whole-of-government, an unprecedented
effort.
Now, on the specifics, since you want specifics, Afghanistan is an agricultural country. It exported agricultural products
until 1978 and the Soviet invasion. We are trying to rebuild it. This was not being done for the first seven years of this
war.
We have -- your -- your committee has given us a great deal of money for agriculture. And we are spending it wisely in
a joint AID- USDA effort, which Senator Lugar has particularly been involved in, food, seeds, cash-for-work programs,
encouraging alternatives to opium production.
HOLBROOKE:
Secondly, rule of law. We are spending -- we are spending the money you have authorized for us to create a justice
system which can cut into the Taliban's propaganda about corruption and lack of a justice system.
Third, counter-narcotics. We have ended poppy eradication, a radical change, because all we were doing by
eradicating poppy seeds, poppy crops, was driving farmers, poor farmers, into the hands of the Taliban.
Fourth, a major program of subnational governance, where we are putting aid directly to the district level.
Fifth, a major effort in specific areas, some of which were alluded to earlier, such as electricity for Kandahar. Senator
Kerry asked earlier about Kandahar. One of the major issues here is to bring electricity to the people as a benefit of the
international presence.
The whole range of activities we have is designed to support the country and to support General Petraeus' counter-
insurgency effort. He and I -- I was his counterpart until two weeks ago when he moved to Kabul. We have worked
intimately in an effort to create a joint civilian-military effort. And I am happy to provide you with every detail you wish
in private briefings on behalf of me and my team.
Point number two in regard to the end state issue you raised. I want to be clear on the difference between end state
and exit strategy.
If we -- this is my personal view, senator -- but if we walk away from Afghanistan, again, as we did 21 years ago, the
consequences will be similarly catastrophic, because of the unique strategic position of Afghanistan and the reaction
that would have in Pakistan, China, India and the country to Afghanistan's west, Iran, as well as the larger region that
includes Russia, Saudi Arabia, India, and even extending to Western Europe, which is concerned about terrorism from
that region, just as much as we are.
So, I hope that when we talk about end state, we talk about a sustainable end state which involves continued
American economic and development assistance, and we continue to fulfill our obligations to train the police and the
military. This will not be cheap. But it will be a fraction of the money that is now being authorized and appropriated for
the military campaign.
When we will be able to transition to that is impossible for me or anyone to say. But it won't be on a single day. It will
be a gradual process. And that is what the review in December and the president's decision-making will focus on.
CORKER:
In our foreign policy, generally speaking -- I know we've had some rough times over the last several years -- it's been
something that we've been able to address in a bipartisan way. And I think that the issues that you're dealing with, that
we're dealing with in Afghanistan are incredibly tough.
I still don't -- I haven't understood what the administration was saying in the beginning. That's not to be critical of
them. I just don't understand. I still don't understand. I've met with you and your staff over at the State Department. It's
just incredibly vague to me.
And I think what we are doing, we have partners, which include the Pakistanis and everybody around, that they don't
know what we're doing. They don't know when we're leaving. They think we're leaving shortly, I think. We've just had
colleagues who have come from there.
We've had a -- we've got a president there that's having to play both sides, because he wants to survive, because he
doesn't know what our intentions are. The Pakistanis don't know what our intentions are, I don't think. And they're
making accommodations on both sides.
So, I just have to tell you, I send letters to parents and spouses. And what I feel because of this lack of clarity is that we
are in Afghanistan, because we're in Afghanistan, and that we don't have the will to be successful. And we don't have
the will to leave, because of some of the things you just outlined.
But I just don't hear any clarity. And again, I want to support the administration. I want to support you, because that's
what we need to do as a country, is let the shores (ph) align (ph), let the partisanship.
But I have to tell you, as a person who wants to do that, I still don't understand. OK? And I have average intelligence,
so I would ask you to, please -- or maybe let's have some witnesses in here that can shed more light or be more specific.
But I don't understand, and I'm very concerned.
And I think we're sending a lot of mixed signals. And I think there's a lot of dissension. Actually, as I listen to you, even
within the administration itself, and that has to end.
And I just ask you, please. You have a lot of experience, help us understand. You haven't done that today. And I would
ask the chairman to please have some witnesses come in and explain to us what the end state is, what we can envision
Afghanistan being whenever this withdrawal does take place, because I still do not understand.
We've changed it. Now it's sort of a degraded country where they have conflict, but it's not out of control. I mean, the
bar continues to change. And I'm just concerned as an individual, and yet I want us to be, if we can, all on the same page
as much as possible. But I think to do that, this has got to be much clearer than has been outlined.
HOLBROOKE:
Senator, I'm sorry that my answers don't fully satisfy you. But I want to be very clear on this, because I understand
your comments and I respect them.
First of all, the core question -- the one you are asked by your constituents, and I'm asked by everybody -- why are we
in Afghanistan? The short, simple answer is 9/11, direct threats to our national security interests, and the fact that while
our enemies against our homeland are on the Pakistani side of the border, this is a single struggle. And we have to
strengthen the Afghan government and let -- and teach it to stand on its own feet over time, so that we can move
forward, while we do other things that fall outside the scope of this hearing, to dismantle, deter and defeat Al Qaida.
Now, if you do not believe that it's a threat to the homeland, then we have an honest difference of opinion. But I think
the Times Square bombing incident shows clearly how dangerous that situation is.
Secondly, on the civilian mission, again, it's in support of a single, civilian-military, counter-insurgency mission. And we
have benchmarks, requested and required by the Congress, and submitted to you. And our overarching goal here is
always the same, to disrupt, dismantle and defeat Al Qaida and prevent its ability to threaten the United States.
And we believe, all of us -- and there is no division on this in the executive branch -- that the situation we face out
there is a direct threat. We believe that before the Times Square situation occurred, and I don't think anything could
have proved it more vividly.
And to achieve this, we have to degrade the Taliban as well, because they are part of the enemy's structure -- a
different part, but an integral part -- that we face.
Now, the Afghan government doesn't yet have the capacity to deal with this on its own. How could they after 30 years
of war? And so, the civilian part of it, the things I've just mentioned to you -- police, government capacity, rule of law,
subnational government, training provincial officials, women's empowerment and a whole series of other major issues --
are part of our civilian programs.
And we're happy to come back up to your office -- we appreciated your visit to us -- and continue this dialogue.
Our civilian strategy is designed from keeping Al Qaida at bay, and it's designed to help Afghan institutions establish
conditions for stable governance. Our plan has these benchmarks, which have been briefed to you and your colleagues,
and we're happy to discuss them in detail at any time.","UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770483 Date: 08/31/2015

State Department is taking right steps to foster Internet freedom
Wednesday, July 21, 2010; Al8
BILLIONS OF people live in countries where the Internet is not free. Confined behind the elaborate firewalls of
authoritarian regimes such as China and Iran, they find their rights to expression threatened online and off-- by
elaborate systems of monitoring and censorship and by harsh laws that punish bloggers with imprisonment or
even death.
In January, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton spoke powerfully in support of Internet freedom, saying,
""We stand for a single Internet where all of humanity has equal access to knowledge and ideas. And we
recognize that the world's information infrastructure will become what we and others make of it.""
Since then, the State Department has brought the issue of online freedom to the table in its diplomacy around
the world and joined with Internet providers and social media companies to foster public-private partnership in
Internet freedom. Such collaboration is key, since authoritarian regimes so often contract out the daily work of
censorship to private companies.
Congress, too, has showed commitment to openness online, allocating $35 million in funding between the 2009
and 2010 budgets for work that promotes Internet freedom. This money has yet to be spent, but the State
Department finally has sent the names of designated recipients of the 2009 budget's $5 million in Internet
freedom funding to Congress for its approval and soon will begin the process for distributing this year's grants.
As it moves forward on this vital issue, the State Department must carefully determine how best to spend its
limited resources. Yes, there is no silver bullet to guarantee freedom on the Internet. But it is possible to do

great good with available funds. Investing in censorship-circumvention techniques like those that powered
Tehran's ""Twitter revolution"" in June 2009 could have a tremendous, measurable impact.
Although this solution is not without its problems -- the best-known provider of this software is the Falun Gong-
affiliated Global Internet Freedom consortium, and users behind China's Great Firewall may mistrust the
technology of a group their government has banned -- the State Department must seriously consider channeling
funds to organizations that have demonstrated great potential to make a difference.
The State Department is attempting a more holistic approach to Internet freedom, spreading funds across a
variety of projects. Monitoring the efficacy of chosen solutions and rewarding those that produce results will be
essential as this program continues.
A cyberspace without walls or barriers, where people can assemble and express themselves freely, without fear
of censorship or imprisonment, will make the world safer for the United States and for democracies everywhere.
Continued public-private partnership, prioritization of Internet freedom in diplomacy and the wise deployment
of allocated funds will move this ideal closer to reality.

Subject: (AP) Iran blocks former president's website
TEHRAN (AP) - The website of former Iranian President Khatami announced authorities have blocked it without
explanation.
A statement on Khatami.ir said a government committee had decided to filter the website, which on November 4
could only be reached from inside Iran through proxy servers.
While the site was not known to be controversial, Khatami, president from 1997 to 2005, supported opposition leader
Mir Hossein Mousavi in 2009 presidential election that led to re-election of President Ahmadinejad.
Earlier this year authorities banned Khatami from traveling to Japan to attend a conference.

Interview / Why Israel should end its policy of
nuclear ambiguity
An interview with Avner Cohen, expert on nonproliferation
issues and author of the forthcoming book ""The Worst-Kept
Secret: Israel's Bargain with the Bomb.""
By Nia.
tasha Mozwvava Tags: Israel news
Avner Cohen is a senior fellow of the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies at the Monterey Institute of
International Studies. He is the author of ""Israel and the Bomb"" and the forthcoming ""The Worst-Kept Secret: Israel's
Bargain with the Bomb.""
Avner Cohen, you claim that the time has come for Israel to abandon its policy of nuclear ambiguity. Why now,
and why would that be good for Israel?
""Nuclear ambiguity is a cornerstone of Israeli strategic thinking. It was born many years ago, and sealed as part of a
comprehensive deal with the United States in 1969. It was appropriate at the time, but today. in my opinion, it is not just
anachronistic, but foolish and anti-democratic. Even in realpolitik terms, it is an 'own goal' for Israel. In my view, it
undermines genuine Israeli interests, including the need to gain recognition and legitimacy and to be counted among the
responsible states in this strategic field.""
Are you sure the pressure on Israel is so severe? If Israel is criticized over its nuclear program, its usually
marginal. The brunt of the criticism is over its treatment of the Palestinians. •
""Israel received tacit consent for its nuclear program from the Western world because it appeared to be a small, just state'
surrounded by enemies, and the memory of the Holocaust was still fresh. Israel's image was different then.
""In the long term, the more Israel appears to reject peace and to be the one that opposes a two-state solution, the more it
will be perceived as a regional bully that possesses nuclear weapons. So the world will be a lot less forgiving on the
nuclear issue. The situation of ambiguity, in which you don't have real legitimacy, is not a good place to be.""
The United States has called on Israel to join the nonproliferation treaty, but during Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu's visit to Washington, U.S. President Barack Obama said he recognizes the special nature of the
threats Israel faces, and these threats warrant special security measures.
The Americans want to appear just and fair because the issue is seen in Israel as completely sacred. They want to look
as though they respect that. This agreement [with the U.S.] has been passed along from president to president, but I don't
believe this issue is as sacred to Americans as it is to Israelis.""
Do you give credence to the slippery slope theory, under which abandoning ambiguity would lead to demands
that Israel disarm?
""Those are cliches used by the defense establishment. Nobody 'demands that Israel make such an announcement without
first doing the preparatory work among its allies and the Arab states. This great fear of a slippery slope is ridiculous. Israel
has its own interests; nobody can coerce it to do things.""
What about the claim that ambiguity is what keeps the Arab states from feeling a need to launch an arms race
against Israel?
""I don't dismiss that claim out of hand, and if, after study and thought, this fear turns out to be warranted, I would be
prepared to wait. But in some ways, ambiguity is insulting to the Arabs. The claim you mention treats Arabs as though
they were children: If they are told that Israel doesn't admit to it, that frees them of the need to deal with the reality. I
believe the Arab countries don't want to play a game of make-believe, but rather want to discuss the topic directly and
realistically.""
You say, basically, that Iran is imitating Israel's nuclear behavior. That comparison would certainly rankle Israel
supporters.
""But the way Iran has advanced toward nuclear capability is not via announcements and tests, but rather by rumors. It can
even remain within the bounds of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. If that rankles anybody, let it rankle.
""If Iran is not attacked, it will want to achieve a status of ambiguity; I see this as nearly certain. The international
community thus has another reason not to accept the idea of ambiguity as legitimate. The norm that a state with a nuclear
weapon must say so clearly is part of the nonproliferation regime. The longer Iran continues down this path, the less
patience the world will have for Israel.""
How do you envision the scenario of 'coming out of the nuclear closet?'
""Censorship plays a very central role in the enforcement of nuclear ambiguity. So long as there is a [military] censor, it is
very hard to alter ambiguity. If censorship didn't exist, israeli newspapers would be able to write about the subject more
openly.
""Another issue is the need for a law that addresses the nuclear topic. There is a Shin Bet [security service] law, but there
is no law for the Mossad and no law for the Israel Atomic Energy Commission. This is a very problematic situation.
""On the international level, it's a sensitive subject that demands preparatory work. Ultimately, I see a political statement by
Israel's government in which the prime minister would find the right way to put this subject on the table. He would talk
about the historical background and the responsible way Israel has dealt with this topic. With a few rare exceptions, these
weapons have no military use; Israel views them as a means of deterrence. I don't think Israel would need to go into detail
regarding how many [bombs] it has or exactly what it has.
""Israel has a right to the bomb no less than New Delhi, or even the United States. Ambiguity creates a sense that we are
sinners, as though we had done something so terrible that we can't tell the awful truth - and I don't think it is so awful. This
is a country that the world has viewed as a nuclear state for a long time, and the time has come for it to say something
positive on this huge, complicated and awe-inspiring topic...
""All these states are ultimately committed under the treaty they signed to achieve a world without nuclear weapons.
Whether that will happen in our lifetimes I can't say.""
You say ambiguity undermines Israeli democracy and prevents debate on matters of life and death, such as the
question of whose finger will be on the button. Do you think the Israeli public is ready for such a discussion?
""There has been very little creative thinking in this area, and ambiguity is one of the stifling factors that have produced an
unacceptable, closed culture incapable of creative thinking. Ambiguity's power derives from the fact that Israeli society
accepts it, and it seems to the public that any attempt to deviate from it would cause serious damage to Israeli security.
""Ambiguity has created a public incapable of dealing with the topic, one that is afraid of it and prefers the issue to be
handled by 'trustworthy hands' so that it does not have to take responsibility itself.
Ambiguity has created an ignorant, craven public.which, in a certain sense, has betrayed its civic, democratic duties on
this subject.""
What's it like researching a topic nobody discusses?
""When I started studying this subject 25 years ago, I had the feeling I was entering a palace where nothing could be
touched. It took me years to find the right way to handle the topic responsibly - from a researcher's perspective, not from
the standpoint of someone who is directly involved in the matter.
Today I think it is possible to initiate a meaningful dialogue about concrete, real issues.""

A poisoned process holds little hope
By David Gardner
Published: August 25 2010 22:46 1 Last updated: August 25 2010 22:46
As the caravans of Middle East peace negotiators rumble into Washington next
week for the umpteenth time, the pervasive cynicism and sense of deja vu all
over again is overwhelming -.and with good reason.
The Middle East peace process long ago turned into a tortured charade of pure
process while events on the ground - in particular the relentless and strategic
Israeli colonisation of occupied Palestinian land. - pull in the opposite
direction to peace. ""We have all been colluding in a gigantic confidence trick,""
is how one Arab minister puts it, ""and here we go again.""
While many factors had combined to hand veto powers to rejectionists on both
sides, the heart of the question remains the continuing Israeli occupation. ‘7""
is essential to remember that the biggest single increase of Jewish settlers on
Arab land - a 50 per cent rise - took place in 1992-96 under the governments of
peace-makers Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres at the high-water mark of the Oslo
peace accords. Many Israelis will point to the perfidy of the late Yassir
Arafat, who wanted to talk peace but keep the option of armed resistance

dangerously in play. But what killed Oslo was the occupation. The second
intifada that erupted a decade ago was essentially the Oslo war.
A decade on, the Israeli settlement enterprise has turned the occupied West Bank
into a discontiguous scattering of cantons, walled in by a security barrier
built on yet more annexed Arab land and criss-crossed by segregated Israeli
roads linking the settlements. Last month, B'Tselem, the Israeli human rights
group, published a study showing Israel has now taken 42 per cent of the West
Bank, with 300,000 settlers there and another 200,000 in East Jerusalem. The
siege of Gaza has turned that sliver of land into a vast, open-air prison.
The main feature of the present situation is the disconnect between the high
politics of the utterly discredited peace process and these - in Israeli
parlance - ""facts on the ground"".
At last month's White House summit, where Barack Obama and Benjamin Netanyahu .
massaged their long estrangement into a political armistice, the US president
praised the Israeli prime minister as a leader ""willing to take risks for
peace"".
But there is no evidence for this whatsoever. True, in June last year, in
response to Mr Obama's Cairo speech denying any legitimacy to Israel's
settlements, Mr Netanyahu forced himself to utter the words ""Palestinian state""
- but he surrounded them with barbed-wire caveats that voided them of meaning.
Indeed, the words all sides use - peace, resolution, security, and so on - may

be the same; but what each side means by them is different.
The mainstream Palestinian leaders, President Mahmoud Abbas and Salam Fayyad,
the prime minister, and the Quartet made up of the US, the European Union, the
UN and Russia, talk of a negotiated resolution. This means two states living in
peace and security, and a Palestinian homeland on the 22 per cent of Mandate
Palestine taken by Israel in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. East Jerusalem would
serve as the capital of the West Bank and Gaza, with marginal land swaps to
preserve some Israeli settlements near Jerusalem. But what does Mr Netanyahu
mean?
He has been most clear on what he does not mean. For a start, he has set his
face—against any concessions on Jerusalem. He wants to .keep most settlements
except for the far-flung ""ideological"" ones and the 100-plus ""outposts""
established as pawns to be traded once the chess game began. His idea of a
demilitarised Palestinian state is more like a sort of supra-municipal
administration than a self-determined, independent government.
Will he surprise us, on the hackneyed Nixon and China principle that holds it is
politicians of the right who most easily close difficult deals? There is little
to suggest that.
The thinking of Mr Netanyahu, son of a celebrated promoter of Greater Israel,
has always been profoundly irredentist. While his nationalist Likud faces the
constraints of being in coalition with an assortment of ultra-rightist and
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05771423 Date: 08/31/2015

ultra-orthodox parties as well as Labour, that was plainly his choice; the
centrist Kadima party was (and remains) an alternative. To be fair, Israel's
electoral system - with a low threshold for entry into the Knesset that makes
multi-party coalitions inevitable - means lObbies such as the settlers can take
the national interest hostage. But Mr Netanyahu magnifies this by his choice of
partners and by diligently firing up the ultra-hawks in the pro-Israel lobby in
the US.
As risks he has taken for peace, Exhibit A is the much-hyped moratorium on
settlement-building, which expires next month and has, in any case, been
speciously interpreted. While the bulldozers to build settlements have been
idling, moreover, the bulldozers demolishing Palestinian homes have been
roaring: the rate of demolition in and around Jerusalem has doubled this year,
while the army has lust razed the village of al-Farisiye in the Jordan Valley,
in line with Mr Netanyahu's strategically obsolete obsession with keeping the
valley as Israel's eastern border.
As diplomacy struggles to keep alive the viability of a two-state solution,
three rival systems of control have crystallised in the occupied territories
that would make up a future Palestinian homeland: the settlements; the crimped.
Palestinian Authority of Mr Abbas and Mr Fayyad; and then Hamas, which Israel
and its Arab and western allies have tried and failed to marginalise. Time is
short for a negotiated outcome; it may even have run out.

The outlines of a deal are clear, in the (Bill) Clinton parameters of 2000 and
'Arab Peace Initiative of 2002, endorsed by 22 Arab and 57 Muslim countries (as
well as Hamas, as part of the 2007 Mecca accord). There has to be an end to the
occupation, and the US and Quartet cannot just allude to this; they must demand
it.

WASHINGTON
April 20, 2010
The Honorable Kent Conrad, Chairman
Committee on the Budget
United States Senate •
Washington, D.C. 20510
Dear Mr. Chairman:
I am asking your help in supporting the State and,USAID budget request kw
FY 2011. I appreciate the difficult budget environment that confronts the
Congress, but 1 strongly believe this budget request is critical to advancing U.S.
national security and our interests around the world.
Our request totals $52.8 billion — a $4.9 billion increase over 2010. 01 that
increase, $3.6 billion goes directly to ""frontline states"" — Afghanistan, Pakistan,
and Iraq. All other State and USA1D funding grows by $1.3 billion or a 2.7
percent increase, and allows us to tackle the transnational problems of poverty,
food insecurity, climate change, and disease that pose serious threats to American
interests.
Our diplomatic and development tools enhance American leadership.
strengthen our alliances, and build new partnerships to confront pressing global
challenges. Full funding in FY 11 will allow us to continue making tangible
progress in securing the hard fought gains achieved in Iraq, and to continue
supporting and deploying hundreds of civilians in Afghanistan and PakiS UM to help
stabilize dangerous but improving situations.
The recent attacks on United States,personnel and facilities from Juarez.
Mexico, to Peshawar, Pakistan, reinforce what We already know — America's
diplomats and development professionals are on the front lines, protecting. and
securing our vital national security interests around the world.
Congress has rightly demanded that we use all the tools in our national
security tool belt; that we put more diplomats and development experts on the
ground, shoulder-to-shoulder with our troops; and that we do everything possible
to secure America's interests around the world. We are doing our part at the State
Department and USA1D, but we need your help with the FY II request. Our

RIYADH (AP) - A senior Saudi official says the kingdom's aged ruler will fly to the United States for ""medical tests."" The
official says King Abdullah will leave the kingdom on November 22, three days after he was admitted to the hospital
suffering from back pain due to a blood clot. The 86-year-old Crown Prince Sultan, who himself spent over a year in the
U.S. and Morocco for medical treatment and recuperation, will arrive at Riyadh on November 21 to oversee the
kingdom, the official said. The official spoke late November 20 on condition of anonymity because he was not
authorized to speak to the press. The palace said November 19 that King Abdullah was hospitalized after a blood clot
had created pressure on the nerves surrounding a ruptured disc.

Subject: (Haaretz) Israeli Labor party expects new settlement freeze as payoff for loyalty oath
(Hareetz) Labor party ministers angered by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's snap decision to back a
controversial citizenship loyalty oath said late October 6 that they expected a new freeze in settlement
building as a payoff. Netanyahu neglected to inform his Labor coalition partners that he had approved a
right-wing minister's draft of a new oath that would require anyone taking Israeli citizenship to swear
allegiance to Israel as a ""Jewish and democratic state.""
The move paves the way for a vote in the Knesset and was hailed as victory by ultra-nationalist Foreign
Minister Avigdor Lieberman's Israel our Home party, Netanyahu's major coalition partner. But the prime
minister must perform a balancing act. Allies at both ends of the political spectrum and the Labor party
hope that his latest concession is a sop to right-wingers ahead of a decision to renew a ban on settlement
building in the West Bank - a key demand of the left.

By Samuel R. Berger
Samuel R. Berger, chair of the global strategy firm Albright Stonebridge Group, served as national security advisor to
President Clinton from 1997 to 2001.
President Obama's National Security Strategy, released by the White House on Thursday, tackles a delicate but
unavoidable question: How do we respond to new and old security challenges in an era of financial distress at home and
a reordering of political power abroad?
For some time now, it has been clear that the definition of U.S. national security strategy needs rethinking. The
September 11 attacks, global economic crisis, cyber-terror threats and even the environmental catastrophe in the Gulf
underscore that the challenges America faces in 2010 have changed even from just a decade ago. And while America's
military supremacy is certainly not at risk, new international arrangements - such as the shift from the G-7 club of
powerful nations to the G-20, which incorporates emerging nations from China to Brazil - are needed so that the costs
and benefits of a stable international order are shared. The United States cannot solve most global threats without
others, nor should we bear the burden alone.
Enter the National Security Strategy. In my experience, these congressionally mandated documents can easily become
laborious and impenetrable, or mere compendiums of bureaucratic pleading from various parts of the government.
(Make sure you do right by Japan! Don't step on the Pentagon!) The challenge, which President Clinton insisted upon to
me and his other advisers, is to provide a strategic framework that is clarifying to the rest of the world and informs
administration decision makers up and down the line. It's not a blueprint for action, but a means to convey the
president's principles and priorities.
In Obama's case, the new sober and comprehensive 52-page strategy incorporates the new realities and breaks with
past strategies in several key respects. But it also reflects an understanding that we face enduring challenges - nuclear
proliferation, terrorism and regional conflicts - for which the best response is a return to fundamentals.
One such fundamental is the strength of our economy. At a time when the after-effects of a financial crisis and the fiscal
burden of two long wars have raised fears of an overextended America, the administration makes a case for economic
and technological renewal as a crucial underpinning of U.S. security. The president made this case in his West Point
speech last weekend. ""At no time in human history,"" he said, ""has a nation of diminished economic vitality maintained
its military and political primacy.""
Another fundamental challenge is arms control and nuclear proliferation. By seeking strategic arms cuts with Russia, the
president has returned to a long bipartisan tradition that languished during the prior administration. And by convening a
global summit on securing nuclear material this spring, Obama has given new urgency and global purchase to the effort
started in 1991 when Sens. Sam Nunn and Richard Lugar first initiated a program to lock down nuclear materials.
On terrorism, the strategy builds on the past, but breaks with it as well. Presidents Clinton, Bush and Obama each have
deployed all of America's tools: military power, homeland defense, law enforcement, sanctions, intelligence and
vigorous efforts to cut off terrorist financing. But the critical difference in the Obama strategy is that it rejects the Global
War on Terror lens through which the prior administration viewed the challenge. ""This is not a global war against a tactic
- terrorism - or a religion - Islam,"" the new strategy says. ""We are at war with a specific network, al-Qaeda and its
terrorist affiliates.""
This sharper focus avoids alienating many in the Muslim world, ensures the support of key allies who never accepted the
broader construct and avoids the overreactions that led us to forsake the fight against al-Qaeda fight in Afghanistan and
turn our efforts to the unrelated threat from Saddam Hussein's Iraq.
In perhaps the most dramatic departure from the strategy of its predecessor, the Obama administration has restored a
less provocative policy on the use of military force. In the 2002 national security strategy, President Bush articulated the
rationale for preemptive war just weeks before seeking a U.N. resolution to invade Iraq. The new strategy restores the
principles that have guided administrations for decades: the use of force should be a last resort, should weigh all the
costs and benefits, and should have as much international support as possible. The administration reserves the right to
act unilaterally - for example against al-Qaeda and its allies - but resurrects the principle President Clinton often
described as ""together where possible, alone where necessary.""
President Obama's critics have focused on his diplomatic engagement with hostile states like Iran and North Korea. The
President sets forth his rationale: ""to create opportunities to resolve differences, strengthen the international
community's support for our actions, learn about the intentions and nature of closed regimes, and plainly demonstrate
to the public within those nations that their governments are to blame for their isolation.""
In the case of Iran, Washington's outstretched hand has not resulted in Iran's compliance. But attempts to engage have
helped ensure that the world's attention is focused on Iran's intransigence rather than Washington's refusal to
negotiate.
Without a doubt, there are gaps between principle and practice. Despite the Obama administration's stated goal of
doubling exports in the next five years, it has not put its muscle behind trade agreements with South Korea, Panama and
Colombia. And the clarity of its call to respect human rights has at times been muted in the face of tough realities.
Sixteen months into this administration there has been much progress, but many of the true tests of this strategy lie
ahead.
In the strategy's conclusions, the Obama administration evokes an even earlier era, calling for both political parties to
restore the cooperation and common purpose so crucial to our success during the dark days of the Cold War. Despite
the intense debates at the time over nuclear arms control, Central America and détente, nearly all American supported
the containment of communism.
In that same spirit, the administration's framework deserves broad bipartisan support. We can and should argue out our
differences over detention of prisoners, methods to disarm dangerous states, how hard to push for democratic rights, or
the costs of climate change legislation. But at the same time, we can rally around the overriding U.S. foreign policy goals
spelled out in the strategy: renewing our economy at home to ensure leadership abroad; defeating al-Qaeda; succeeding
in Afghanistan; preventing nuclear proliferation; curbing climate change; and promoting an international order of
enlightened self-interest, economic prosperity and the fundamental values upon which America is based.","RELEASE IN PART

global summit on securing nuclear material this spring, Obama has given new urgency and global purchase to the effort
started in 1991 when Sens. Sam Nunn and Richard Lugar first initiated a program to lock down nuclear materials.
On terrorism, the strategy builds on the past, but breaks with it as well. Presidents Clinton, Bush and Obama each have
deployed all of America's tools: military power, homeland defense, law enforcement, sanctions, intelligence and
vigorous efforts to cut off terrorist financing. But the critical difference in the Obama strategy is that it rejects the Global
War on Terror lens through which the prior administration viewed the challenge. ""This is not a global war against a tactic
- terrorism - or a religion - Islam,"" the new strategy says. ""We are at war with a specific network, al-Qaeda and its
terrorist affiliates.""
This sharper focus avoids alienating many in the Muslim world, ensures the support of key allies who never accepted the
broader construct and avoids the overreactions that led us to forsake the fight against al-Qaeda fight in Afghanistan and
turn our efforts to the unrelated threat from Saddam Hussein's Iraq.
In perhaps the most dramatic departure from the strategy of its predecessor, the Obama administration has restored a
less provocative policy on the use of military force. In the 2002 national security strategy, President Bush articulated the
rationale for preemptive war just weeks before seeking a U.N. resolution to invade Iraq. The new strategy restores the
principles that have guided administrations for decades: the use of force should be a last resort, should weigh all the
costs and benefits, and should have as much international support as possible. The administration reserves the right to
act unilaterally - for example against al-Qaeda and its allies - but resurrects the principle President Clinton often
described as ""together where possible, alone where necessary.""
President Obama's critics have focused on his diplomatic engagement with hostile states like Iran and North Korea. The
President sets forth his rationale: ""to create opportunities to resolve differences, strengthen the international
community's support for our actions, learn about the intentions and nature of closed regimes, and plainly demonstrate
to the public within those nations that their governments are to blame for their isolation.""
In the case of Iran, Washington's outstretched hand has not resulted in Iran's compliance. But attempts to engage have
helped ensure that the world's attention is focused on Iran's intransigence rather than Washington's refusal to
negotiate.
Without a doubt, there are gaps between principle and practice. Despite the Obama administration's stated goal of
doubling exports in the next five years, it has not put its muscle behind trade agreements with South Korea, Panama and
Colombia. And the clarity of its call to respect human rights has at times been muted in the face of tough realities.
Sixteen months into this administration there has been much progress, but many of the true tests of this strategy lie
ahead.
In the strategy's conclusions, the Obama administration evokes an even earlier era, calling for both political parties to
restore the cooperation and common purpose so crucial to our success during the dark days of the Cold War. Despite
the intense debates at the time over nuclear arms control, Central America and détente, nearly all American supported
the containment of communism.
In that same spirit, the administration's framework deserves broad bipartisan support. We can and should argue out our
differences over detention of prisoners, methods to disarm dangerous states, how hard to push for democratic rights, or
the costs of climate change legislation. But at the same time, we can rally around the overriding U.S. foreign policy goals
spelled out in the strategy: renewing our economy at home to ensure leadership abroad; defeating al-Qaeda; succeeding
in Afghanistan; preventing nuclear proliferation; curbing climate change; and promoting an international order of
enlightened self-interest, economic prosperity and the fundamental values upon which America is based.

Re: British election
First and most important: Do NOT, repeat, NOT, call any prospective winner on
either Election Night, May 6, or on the next day, Friday, May 7. The result will
be unclear. It will not be clear, even perhaps by Friday afternoon. Today, the
combined polls show Cameron and the Conservatives ahead but not winning an
outright majority. The latest Guardian poll, out tomorrow, shown me by Alan
Rusbridger today, has the Tories falling short of a majority of seats. Even if
Cameron were to win an outright majority, Brown and Labour will attempt to make
a deal with Clegg and the Liberal Democrats. Brown remains as Prime Minister
unless the Tories win outright, which take a longtime to determine. Labour and
the Lib-Dems will almost certainly gain about 60 percent of the vote, more or
less. Brown will reach out to Clegg to stay in power. The deal will be that
Brown will approve a referendum on proportional representation giving the LDs
much greater representationin future elections. That will spell the end forever
of the Tories ever coming to power. The Tories see the election in apocalyptic
terms—and they are not wrong. Brown's weakness heralds the sort of grand
progressive coalition/alliance that Tony imagined but was never able to attempt
between Labour and the LDs. Brown offering the referendum would be the first
step toward that. In the case of the Tories falling short of an outright
majority in seats, they will respond as though Brown is acting illegitimately,
which he would not be by remaining as PM and dealing with Clegg. Informed people
are already talking of what might begin to unfold on Friday as ""Florida."" The
Tories, backed by the Murdoch press, will attempt to push Labour aside by force
majeure—something that will not succeed under those circumstances. The Murdochs
are almost literally going crazy. James Murdoch and hiw wife stormed into the
offices of The Independent, not a Murdoch paper, when the paper endorsed the LDs

and confronted the publisher, screaming in the middle of the newsroom. Murdoch
would be a big, big loser if Cameron loses. Another possibile outcome is that
the Conservatives come up just short and attempt their own deal with the DUP to
cover the gap in seats. Shaun is on to this potential, has been talking to Peter
Robinson.
No matter what, keep your powder dry until the result is crystal clear. Wait.

As we discussed during your salon dinner with Steve Clemons at Nora's, I am developing a practical strategy of
""off-shore/on-shore balancing"" that would involve key USG agencies.
As the attached proposal explains, the new strategy is substantially different from previous historical constructs
in the literature on American grand strategy and offers important advantages to improve our position in
Afghanistan and other regions in the world in the coming years.
Going forward, I would like make sure I have State's views correct. If you and your staff could meet with me

I look forward to further discussion.

The political genius of supply-side economics
Martin Wolf
Financial Times
July 25, 2010 4:18pm I 5
. ,zzq
1h. H)t!..re LH. oclic■/ was intensely debated in the FT last week. In this Exchange, I want to examine what is going on
in '.he ..tS and, in particular, what is going on inside the Republican party. This matters for the US and, because the US
remains the world's most important economy, it also matters greatly for the world.
My reading of contemporary Republican thinking is that there is no chance of any attempt to arrest adverse long-term
fiscal trends should they return to power. Moreover, since the Republicans have no interest in doing anything sensible, the
Democrats will gain nothing from trying to do much either. That is the lesson Democrats have to draw from the Clinton
era's successful frugality, which merely gave George W. Bush the opportunity to make massive (irresponsible and
unsustainable) tax cuts. In practice, then, nothing will be done.
Indeed, nothing may be done even if a genuine fiscal crisis were to emerge. According to my friend, 5rpc*. Uartiett, a
highly informed, if jaundiced, observer, some ""conservatives"" (in truth, extreme radicals) think a federal default would be
an effective way to bring public spending they detest under control. It should be noted, in passing, that a federal default
would surely create the biggest financial crisis in world economic history.
To understand modern Republican thinking on fiscal policy, we need to go back to perhaps the most politically brilliant
(albeit economically unconvincing) idea in the history of fiscal policy: ""supply-side economics"". Supply-side economics
liberated conservatives from any need to insist on fiscal rectitude and balanced budgets. Supply-side economics said that
one could cut taxes and balance budgets, because incentive effects would generate new activity and so higher revenue.
The political genius of this idea is evident. Supply-side economics transformed Republicans from a minority party into a
majority party. It allowed them to promise lower taxes, lower deficits and, in effect, unchanged spending. Why should
people not like this combination? Who does not like a free lunch?
How did supply-side economics bring these benefits? First, it allowed conservatives to ignore deficits. They could argue
that, whatever the impact of the tax cuts in the short run, they would bring the budget back into balance, in the longer run.
Second, the theory gave an economic justification — the argument from incentives - for lowering taxes on politically
important supporters. Finally, if deficits did not, in fact, disappear, conservatives could fall back on the ""starve the beast""
theory: deficits would create a fiscal crisis that would force the government to cut spending and even destroy the hated
welfare state.
In this way, the Republicans were transformed from a balanced-budget party to a tax-cutting party. This innovative stance
proved highly politically effective, consistently putting the Democrats at a political disadvantage. It also made the
Republicans de facto Keynesians in a de facto Keynesian nation. Whatever the rhetoric, I have long considered the US
the advanced world's most Keynesian nation — the one in which government (including the Federal Reserve) is most
expected to generate healthy demand at all times, largely because jobs are, in the US, the only safety net for those of
working age.
True, the theory that cuts would pay for themselves has proved altogether wrong. That this might well be the case was
evident: cutting tax rates from, say, 30 per cent to zero would unambiguously reduce revenue to zero. This is not to argue
there were no incentive effects. But they were not large enough to offset the fiscal impact of the cuts (see, on this,
Wikioedial and a nice chart from Paul Krugniarl
Indeed, Greg Mankiw, no less, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under George W. Bush, has responded to
the view that broad-based tax cuts would pay for themselves, as follows: ""I did not find such a claim credible, based on
the available evidence. I never have, and I still don't."" Indeed, he has referred to those who believe this as ""charlatans and
cranks"". Those are his words, not mine, though I agree. They apply, in force, to contemporary Republicans, alas,

Since the fiscal theory of supply-side economics did not work, the tax-cutting eras of Ronald Reagan and George H. Bush
and again of George W. Bush saw very substantial rises in ratios of federal debt to gross domestic product. Under
Reagan and the first Bush, the ratio of public debt to GDP went from 33 per cent to 64 per cent. It fell to 57 per cent under
Bill Clinton. It then rose to 69 per cent gilder the second (
.
..73e
.proe Bush. Equally, tax cuts in the era of George W. Bush,
wars and the economic crisis account for almost all the dire fiscal outlook for the next ten years (see the Center on Budget
and Policy Priorities).
Today's extremely high deficits are also an inheritance from Bush-era tax-and-spending policies and the financial crisis,
also, of course, inherited by the present administration. Thus, according to the international Monetary Fund the impact of
discretionary stimulus on the US fiscal deficit amounts to a cumulative total of 4.7 per cent of GDP in 2009 and 2010,
while the cumuiative deficit over these years is forecast at 23.5 cer cent of GDP. In any case, the stimulus was certainly
too small, not too large.
The evidence shows, then, that contemporary conservatives (unlike those of old) simply do not think deficits matter, as
former vice-president Richard Cheney is recorted to have tolo forme,. treasury secretary Paul O'Neill. But this is not
because the supply-side theory of self-financing tax cuts, on which Reagan era tax cuts were justified, has worked, but
despite the fact it has not. The faith has outlived its economic (though not its political) rationale.
So, when Republicans assail the deficits under President Ot.)ama, are they to be taken seriously? Yes and no. Yes, they
are politically interested in blaming Mr Obama for deficits, since all is viewed fair in love and partisan politics. And yes,
they are, indeed, rhetorically opposed to deficits created by extra spending (although that did not prevent them from
enacting the unfunded prescription drug benefit, under President Bush). But no, it is not deficits themselves that worry
Republicans, but rather how they are caused: deficits caused by tax cuts are fine; but spending increases brought in by
Democrats are diabolical, unless on the military.
Indeed, this is precisely what John Ky:Lo
...rizonal. a_senior Republican senalcr, has just said:
""[Ylou should never raise taxes in order to cut taxes. Surely Congress has the authority, and it would be
right to — if we decide we want to cut taxes to spur the economy, not to have to raise taxes in order to
offset those costs. You do need to offset the cost of increased spending, and that's what Republicans
object to. But you should never have to offset the cost of a deliberate decision to reduce tax rates on
Americans""
What conclusions should outsiders draw about the likely future of US fiscal policy? .
First, if Republicans win the mid-terms in November, as seems likely, they are surely going to come up with huge tax cut
proposals (probably well beyond extending the already unaffordable Bush-era tax cuts).
Second, the White House will probably veto these cuts, making itself even more Politically unpopular.
Third, some additional fiscal stimulus is, in fact, what the US needs, in the short term, even though across-the-board tax
cuts are an extremely inefficient way of providing it.
Fourth, the Republican proposals would not, alas, be short term, but dangerously long term, in their impact.
Finally, with one party indifferent to deficits, provided they are brought about by tax cuts, and the other party relatively
fiscally responsible (well, everything is relative, after all), but opposed to spending cuts on core programmes, US fiscal
policy is paralysed. I may think the policies of the la L::
.._:agvernscei:jt dangerously austere, but at least it can act.
This is extraordinarily dangerous. The danger does not arise from the fiscal deficits of today, but the attitudes to fiscal
policy, over the long run, of one of the two main parties. Those radical conservatives (a small minority, I hope) who want
to destroy the credit of the US federal government may succeed. If so, that would be the end of the US era of global
dominance. The destruction of fiscal credibility could be the outcome of the policies of the party that considers itself the
most patriotic.
In sum, a great deal of trouble lies ahead, for the US and the world.

Re: British election
First and most important: Do NOT, repeat, NOT, call any prospective winner on either Election Night, May 6, or on the
next day, Friday, May 7. The result will be unclear. It will not be clear, even perhaps by Friday afternoon. Today, the
combined polls show Cameron and the Conservatives ahead but not winning an outright majority. The latest Guardian
poll, out tomorrow, shown me by Alan Rusbridger today, has the Tories falling short of a majority of seats. Even if
Cameron were to win an outright majority, Brown and Labour will attempt to make a deal with Clegg and the Liberal
Democrats. Brown remains as Prime Minister unless the Tories win outright, which take a long time to determine.
Labour and the Lib-Dems will almost certainly gain about 60 percent of the vote, more or less. Brown will reach out to
Clegg to stay in power. The deal will be that Brown will approve a referendum on proportional representation giving the
LDs much greater representationin future elections. That will spell the end forever of the Tories ever coming to power.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770129 Date: 08/31/2015
The Tories see the election in apocalyptic terms—and they are not wrong. Brown's weakness heralds the sort of grand
progressive coalition/alliance that Tony imagined but was never able to attempt between Labour and the LDs. Brown
offering the referendum would be the first step toward that. In the case of the Tories falling short of an outright majority
in seats, they will respond as though Brown is acting illegitimately, which he would not be by remaining as PM and
dealing with Clegg. Informed people are already talking of what might begin to unfold on Friday as ""Florida."" The Tories,
backed by the Murdoch press, will attempt to push Labour aside by force majeure—something that will not succeed
under those circumstances. The Murdochs are almost literally going crazy. James Murdoch and hiw wife stormed into
the offices of The Independent, not a Murdoch paper, when the paper endorsed the LDs and confronted the publisher,
screaming in the middle of the newsroom. Murdoch would be a big, big loser if Cameron loses. Another possibile
outcome is that the Conservatives come up just short and attempt their own deal with the DUP to cover the gap in seats.
Shaun is on to this potential, has been talking to Peter Robinson.
No matter what, keep your powder dry until the result is crystal clear. Wait.

To say that the American people are angry is an understatement. The political brain of Americans today reflects a volatile
mixture of fear and fury, and when you mix those together, you get an explosion. The only question at this point is how to
mitigate the damage when the bomb detonates in November.
The bad news is that it's too late for Democrats to do what would have been both good policy and good politics (and what
the House actually did do), namely to pass a major jobs bill when it was clear that the private sector couldn't keep
Americans employed. The ""Obama Doctrine"" should have been that Americans who want to work and have the ability to
contribute to our productivity as a nation should have the right to work, and that if the private sector can't meet the
demand for jobs, we have plenty of roads and bridges to fix, new energy sources to develop and manufacture, and
schools to build and renovate so our kids and workers returning for training can compete in the 21st century global
economy. From having spent much of the last four years testing messages on a range of issues, from immigration to
taxes and deficits, I can say with some certainty that nothing John Boehner or Eric Cantor could say could come within 30
points of generating the enthusiasm -- particularly among swing voters -- of a message that began, ""We don't have a
shortage of work ethic in this country, we have a shortage of work."" That message resonates across the political
spectrum. And it isn't even the strongest message we've tested in the last weeks or months that beats back the toughest
deficit-cutting language the other side can muster.
But it's too late for that. The administration opted for an alternative doctrine, which Larry Summers enunciated on This
Week several months ago: that unemployment is going to remain high for the foreseeable future and eventually come
down -- as if there's nothing we can do about it -- and that they will push here and there for small symbolic measures
whose symbolism tends to escape people who are out of work. It's hard to be excited by symbolism when your children
are hungry or the bank is repossessing your home -- although you didn't do anything to deserve it -- while the people who
did are once again making out like bandits.
Although the situation looks bleak for Democrats in November, it ain't over 'til it's over. Republicans are shooting
themselves in the foot all over the country, running Tea Party candidates who are so far to the right you can't see Middle
America from their porch. And some endangered Democrats will likely see victory in November from theirs if they
understand the public mood and speak to it.
What is that public mood? It can be characterized by a single phrase -- populist anger -- and it cuts across partisan lines.
On the right, it is alloyed with racial anxiety and prejudice. On the left, it is alloyed with tremendous disappointment at
what could have been if we had the kind of bold leadership for which times like these cry out. And among people in the
vast political center, populist anger is alloyed with anxiety and uncertainty -- about their jobs, their homes, and their
children's future.
How to Create a Populist Explosion: A Tragedy in Two Acts
So how did we get here? The story can be told as a tragedy in two acts.
Act I: The GOP Sets the Country on a Course of Economic Destruction and the President Calls for Truth and
Reconciliation without the Truth Part
• A strong economic downturn devolves into a Great Recession, as the stock market crashes and major banks fail.
By October 2008, upper middle class moderate Republicans in the suburbs are so frightened by what's happening
to their assets that they're willing to give Democrats a chance.
• A Republican administration that believes in neither government nor regulation creates a 700 billion bank bailout
with no accountability. Unlike Republicans, who would say ""no"" in a situation like this and let a Great Recession
turn into a Great Depression, Democrats do the right thing, but they don't make it clear from the start that these
are Bush Bailouts and remind Americans, over and over, that the cause of all the bankruptcies is the bankruptcy
of Republican ideology.
• A charismatic young president raises people's hopes and expectations, as he uniquely can. Americans are
frightened, but they are willing and waiting to hear an alternative narrative to ""government is the problem, not the
solution"" and a path back to economic recovery and security.
• The White House refuses to tell the American people three stories they desperately need to hear.
• The first is why the economy has gone into the ditch, and who did it. The president is steadfast in his position that
we should ""look forward, not backward,"" even as the GOP is blocking his every initiative to clean up its mess. As
conservative attacks on him and Democrats increase, he refuses to indict the Republicans in Congress or
President Bush for having destroyed our economy and putting one in eight Americans out of work and one in five
either behind on their mortgage or in the process of having their homes foreclosed by the same bankers who
gambled them away. Why did he need to tell the American people who was responsible for their misery -- and to
repeat it again and again? Because otherwise, if the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression didn't
subside within a year and half, voters would start to associate it with him and his party. This is Neuroscience 101 -
- it's how mental associations are formed. But the president never even uttered George W. Bush's name in his
first year in office, and the first time he did mention Bush was to appoint him, along with former President Clinton,
to co-lead American relief efforts in Haiti. The president doesn't like putting antagonists in any of his stories, but if
forced to, he would cite unnamed ""naysayers,"" ""Washington politics as usual,"" or ""Congress,"" which was
counterproductive given that Congress was held by his party. The guiding belief at the White House implicit in this
messaging strategy was that Americans have a good grasp on economics and good memories:
• The second story the American people needed to hear from the president was why deficit spending is essential
when the economy is spiraling downward. It's not a hard story to tell, even in a sound bite. But one of the best
educators to occupy the Oval Office in decades chose not to educate -- he actually did it once, with prodding, but
never repeated what was a superb explanation --- nor did he remind voters every time his opponents attacked
him for deficit spending that they had left him with a 1.2 trillion dollar deficit on the day he walked into office
because of their unpaid-for tax cuts to millionaires and unpaid-for war on Iraq that called on no one to sacrifice
except our soldiers and their families (and our kids and grandkids, who will be paying off this war for generations).
A year later, with Democrats on the ropes, the president started to tell that story. It was the right move, but
appeared defensive because it hadn't been part of his guiding narrative from the start.
• The third story the president needed to offer was an alternative narrative on government. The president and his
party were about to offer effective government as a solution to multiple problems after 30 years of solid branding
by conservatives since Ronald Reagan about how government is the problem. But the narrative never came.
• The White House and Democratic Congress pass what virtually all economists outside the Goldman Sachs-to-
Washington pipeline consider a half-stimulus that they predict will likely produce half-results. It fulfilled its promise.
But the equally predictable political result was a discrediting of the concept of government intervention to
stimulate the economy in the eyes of the public -- enough to scare off Democratic lawmakers from doing what
they learned about Keynesian economics in intro economics for the indefinite future. Instead of blasting the
Republicans for having hurled the country toward an abyss that would now take drastic measures to avert and
warning the American people that this could easily be the first of two or three trillion-dollar packages that might be
needed to get Americans back to work and to get the gears of the economy grinding again before we could start
returning to the kinds of surpluses Bill Clinton had left the last time a Democrat was in the White House, the
president chose to compromise with a party that was so unpopular when he took office that only 20 percent of
voters at that point would even admit to a pollster that they considered themselves Republicans -- the lowest point
for the GOP since the rise of public opinion polling 50 years earlier.
• The economy continues its free-fall, shedding 700,000 jobs a month. Meanwhile, Democrats don't take the kind of
dramatic steps necessary to stop the bleeding. Americans are becoming desperate, but they remain hopeful that
this new president will turn things around, and that perhaps the jobs provisions of the new ""stimulus"" act will do
cauterize the wound. Meanwhile, the stimulus is being portrayed by Republicans as a mixture of pork and fat, and
no one is effectively answering the charges, creating increasingly negative associations to an act that was never
adequately crafted or sold.
• The logical follow-up to a bill designed to pull the economy out of a ditch is to make such a bill unnecessary in the
future, by attacking Wall Street for having thrown us into crisis and passing strong legislation to rein in the
excesses that created the economic meltdown. This would have sealed the American people's loyalty to the new
president and Congress. (Heading into November, this is, in fact, the most popular piece of legislation the
Democrats have passed, but it took them nearly a year and a half to get there, and by then, neither the president
nor the Democratic Congress enjoyed the good will of the average American.) Instead, the same banks that
received bailouts are foreclosing in record rates on the homeowners whose payroll taxes funded the bailouts but
don't seem to get the same kind of attention to their needs from the federal government. Adding insult to injury,
the banks double and triple credit card interest rates to as high as 30 percent, including on people's existing credit
card debt -- while continuing to receive no-interest loans from the federal government.
• Despite talk of accountability, no one is fired (except one auto executive), virtually no one is prosecuted or even
investigated as far as anyone knows, and banks that received bailouts flaunt record bonuses.
Act II: An Anemic Economy Meets an Anemic Health Care Plan
• The public has been clamoring for health care reform. Over 40 million people don't have health insurance at all,
and the 85 percent of voters who do have health care have seen their costs double during the Bush years at the
same time as real income has declined. Effective narratives on health care are widely available that win by a 2:1
margin against the toughest Harry-and-Louise anti-reform language from the other side. The opposition knows it,
as evident in a leaked memo by Republican wordsmith Frank Luntz, who warns that this will be an uphill climb for
opponents of reform, who would do well to accept some major elements of it.
• But instead of using any of the well-tested narratives that were highly effective during the campaign or devising
any new ones of its own, the administration decides to try to ""sell"" health care without a narrative. (I wrote about
this in detail a year ago and will not repeat that history here, except in telegraphic form.) The president refuses to
state where he stands on any of the substantive debates about health reform for a year, such as whether we
should have a ""public option"" (a term so ill-conceived it's hard to believe the public supported it anyway; imagine
the support it might have received if it had been called instead ""the one health care plan the health insurance
companies don't get to control""). Instead, the White House uses phrases such as ""bending the cost curve"" while
conservatives flood the airwaves with evocative phrases such as ""government takeover,"" ""a bureaucrat between
you and your doctor,"" and ""death panels.""
• Instead of using Big Pharma and the health insurance industry as the villains of the health care story, which would
explain why we need an overhaul rather than a Band-Aid, the White House once again offers a story without
protagonists or antagonists, and cuts secret deals with both industries that become public.
• Over interminable months of trying to get the votes of the same Republicans who fought against Medicare for
seniors for 30 years until the program was just too popular to keep attacking it and who are still trying to gut Social
Security despite its popularity, the public then watches what George Will describes as the ""serial bribery"" of
Republican and Democratic Senators alike, as each gets to take his or her turn as the 60th vote.
• At the 11th hour, as a compromise plan is finally going to pass, the president nixes the idea of a Medicare-like
alternative Americans can choose over a health-insurance industry plan if they so desire, despite 60 percent of
even swing voters wanting it included in the bill.
• Instead of being the signature bill that demonstrates both that Democrats can govern effectively and that
government can be a force for good for working and middle class Americans (who have just been told that the
better plans they've negotiated or been offered for years by their employers are ""Cadillacs"" that are going to be
taxed out of existence), the entire process proves to the average American that government can't do anything
right and scares moderate Democrats away from voting for any other bill that would ever put them on the record
supporting government or spending.
• ""Government"" hits an all-time low in the polls, matching the popularity of big corporations, CEOs, and bailouts.
• Populist anger emerges as the primary emotion across the political spectrum, and the president's job approval
with swing voters drops into the high thirties.
• Following the conventional wisdom, Democrats return to their all-too-familiar defensive crouch, and conclude that
when in trouble, tack right. On health care, the president and his Cabinet fan out all over television to ""reassure""
the public on health care that abortion won't be covered (thanks for the reassurance, but most of us didn't find that
reassuring), that domestic partners won't be covered, and that immigrants won't be covered. None of these issues
needed to be conceded. (I know this because I tested messages on them, and well- messaged progressive
positions on them would have boosted the popularity of the bill with swing voters.)
• The White House starts adopting failed conservative policies and talking points that leave the public utterly
confused about where the president, and by extension, his party, stands on the central issues of the day. The
president talks about cutting deficits and increasing spending in the same breath, using the metaphor of families
tightening their belt in tough times, which only strengthens resolve against stimulating a faltering economy;
pledges support for massively expanding offshore drilling and ""clean coal"" (which doesn't exist, by the way) in a
speech on climate change; and sends in 1200 additional National Guards to Arizona as an apparent reward for
passing ""No Latino Left Behind,"" while publicly objecting to the legislation.
• The underlying psychological assumption of these moves is that if you mix policies from the right and left in equal
parts, you win the center. In fact, no one has ever won the center that way. It appears weak, opportunistic, and
incoherent to the average swing voter, which is particularly problematic at a time when people in the center
desperately want to know that their leaders have a vision and a coherent plan for what to do (which is why both
FDR and Ronald Reagan were so effective in moving voters in the center). It doesn't win any votes on the right.
But it does have one predictable effect: It sucks the motivation out of your base, who feel demoralized and
betrayed (if they're part of the ""professional left"") or less likely to vote (if they're average voters who don't follow
politics carefully but just don't feel very enthusiastic anymore, even if they don't really know why).
• Capping it all off, the BP disaster occurs two weeks after the president has adopted the ""drill here, drill now,"" ""all
of the above"" position of the Republican Party and the oil companies. This could have been the perfect
opportunity to go on the offensive, contrast what Democrats stand for (common sense, protection of our safety,
the land we leave our children, and key American industries and jobs, and sticking up for ordinary Americans
against big businesses and their lobbyists) with what Republicans stand for; and connect the dots between what
happened on Wall Street (with regulators owned and operated by the companies they were supposed to regulate)
and what happened in the Gulf (where precisely the same thing happened). Instead, the administration finds itself
on the defensive, increasingly sounding like a subsidiary of BP, allowing BP to call the shots and control
information for weeks, defending increasingly hard-to-believe statistics, and issuing press releases that appear
indistinguishable from those issued by BP but are inconsistent with assessments of independent scientists.
Where Do We Go from Here?
So that is where we find ourselves today: a Democratic Party and Democratic base that is demoralized and unlikely to
vote in high numbers in November; a Republican Party that is selling replanted Bushes with tremendous enthusiasm; and
a vast political center filled with voters who are utterly confused and unsure who to turn to but certain that things aren't
going well.
In January 2009 no one could have predicted that Democrats would be in this predicament today. Perhaps Democrats
might lose a few seats lost in an off-year election, but certainly no more than that. We had just seen -- and the American
public knew we had just seen -- the most disastrous performance by a president and party in living history, and the
American people had elected a tremendously charismatic young president with enormous Democratic majorities in both
houses of Congress. They had given the president and Congress a strong mandate for whatever kind of change was
necessary to get us out of economic free-fall and to put Americans back to work.
But there were red flags already by the end of Obama's first week in office that led me to offer the following advice to the
new administration: Tell the story of how we got in this mess or you'll own it. Tell a coherent story about deficit spending.
Re-brand government because there's only one story out there now (Reagan's), and it's not one that supports a
progressive agenda. Never let attacks go unanswered, because doing so only emboldens your opposition and leads the
public to believe that you have no answers to them. And if you throw a bipartisan party and no one comes, don't throw
another one. All of what followed has been as predictable as it has been unfortunate. A year and a half later, the White
House hasn't consistently done any of these things, although the President is now intermittently doing some of them, and
when he does, he does them well.
The question today is whether Democrats can channel the populist anger we are seeing around the country this late in the
game. The answer is that we'd better try. Having recently tested messages on economics and jobs, including how to talk
about deficits and taxes -- widely assumed to be Democrats' Achilles Heel, particularly now -- there is little question that if
Democrats and progressives from center to left simply say what they believe in ways that are evocative, values-driven,
and speak to people's worries and 'anger, many stand a good chance of surviving November, particularly when their
opponents have nothing to say other than warmed-over rhetoric about cutting taxes to millionaires and multinationals and
fiscal restraint except where it cuts into profits of their campaign contributors. Even the most evocative boilerplate
conservative messages fall flat against honest messages that speak to the need to get Americans working again. And on
issue after issue, no message is more resonant right now than one that sides with working and middle class Americans
and small business owners against special interests, big business, and their lobbyists.
But actions speak louder than words, and Americans want to see action. It may be too late for the kind of jobs bill we
should have seen a year and a half ago, but it isn't too late for Democrats to go on the offensive against the Republicans -
- virtually all of them -- who opposed extending unemployment insurance to millions of Americans who were thrown out of
work by the Republicans' corporate sponsors. It isn't too late for Democrats to contrast their support for the highly popular
aid to state and local governments that just saved the jobs of hundreds of thousands of teachers, firefighters, and police
all over the country with Republicans' desire to throw them out onto the street. It isn't too late to make a voting issue out of
the bill the Republicans are stalling that would give small businesses a fighting chance in an economy stacked against
them, and to make clear that one party stands for small businesses, which create 75 percent of the new jobs in this
country, and the other party stands for big businesses that outsource American jobs and offshore their profits to avoid
paying their fair share of American taxes. It's not too late to pass a bill that would limit credit card interest rates to a
reasonable percent above the rate at which credit is made available to credit card companies. It's not too late to pass the
first badly need ""fix"" to the health care reform act to demonstrate to Americans that Democrats mean it when they say this
was just the first step, namely a law that stops insurance companies from increasing their premiums by 40 percent while
cutting the size of their networks by 50-75 percent, which violates the principles of affordability and choice that were so
essential to efforts to sell health care reform to the public. It's not too late to vow to change the rules of the Senate to
prevent the use of the filibuster to give every special interest veto power over every important piece of legislation. It's not
too late to introduce legislation that's been on hold in both the House and Senate to guarantee fair elections, so that the
voice of everyday Americans is heard over the voice of the special interests that finance political campaigns.
On every one of these issues, a strong populist message trounces anything the other side can say. But Democrats need
to play offense. They need to take up-or-down votes on bill after bill, including those they expect the other side to block,
knowing that every one of those votes has the leverage of a campaign ad behind it. They need to change the narrative
from what sounds to the average American like a whiny and impotent one -- ""the Republicans won't let us do it"" -- to a
narrative of strength in numbers shared with their constituents. And they need to make every election a choice between
two well-articulated approaches to governance -- and to offer their articulation of both sides' positions and values.
That leads to a final point. What Democrats have needed to offer the American people is a clear narrative about what and
who led our country to the mess in which we find ourselves today and a clear vision of what and who will lead us out. That
narrative would have laid a roadmap for our elected officials and voters alike, rather than making each legislative issue a
seemingly discrete turn onto a dirt road. That narrative might have included -- and should include today -- some key
elements: that if the economy is tumbling, it's the role of leadership and government to stop the free-fall; that if Wall Street
is gambling with our financial security, our homes, and our jobs, true leaders do not sit back helplessly and wax eloquent
aboUt the free market, they take away the dice; that if the private sector can't create jobs for people who want to work,
then we'll put Americans back to work rebuilding our roads, bridges, and schools; that if Big Oil is preventing us from
competing with China's wind and solar energy programs, then we'll eliminate the tax breaks that lead to dysfunctional
investments in 19th century fuels and have a public-private partnership with companies that will create the clean, safe
fuels of the 21st century and the millions of good American jobs that will follow.
That's what Democrats stand for. It's time they said it.

To say that the American people are angry is an understatement. The political brain of Americans today reflects a volatile
mixture of fear and fury, and when you mix those together, you get an explosion. The only question at this point is how to
mitigate the damage when the bomb detonates in November.
The bad news is that it's too late for Democrats to do what would have been both good policy and good politics (and what
the House actually did do), namely to pass a major jobs bill when it was clear that the private sector couldn't keep
Americans employed. The ""Obama Doctrine"" should have been that Americans who want to work and have the ability to
contribute to our productivity as a nation should have the right to work, and that if the private sector can't meet the
demand for jobs, we have plenty of roads and bridges to fix, new energy sources to develop and manufacture, and
schools to build and renovate so our kids and workers returning for training can compete in the 21st century global
economy. From having spent much of the last four years testing messages on a range of issues, from immigration to
taxes and deficits, I can say with some certainty that nothing John Boehner or Eric Cantor could say could come within 30
points of generating the enthusiasm -- particularly among swing voters -- of a message that began, ""We don't have a
shortage of work ethic in this country, we have a shortage of work."" That message resonates across the political
spectrum. And it isn't even the strongest message we've tested in the last weeks or months that beats back the toughest
deficit-cutting language the other side can muster.
But it's too late for that. The administration opted for an alternative doctrine, which Larry Summers enunciated on This
Week several months ago: that unemployment is going to remain high for the foreseeable future and eventually come
down -- as if there's nothing we can do about it -- and that they will push here and there for small symbolic measures
whose symbolism tends to escape people who are out of work. It's hard to be excited by symbolism when your children

are hungry or the bank is repossessing your home -- although you didn't do anything to deserve it -- while the people who
did are once again making out like bandits.
Although the situation looks bleak for Democrats in November, it ain't over 'til it's over. Republicans are shooting
themselves in the foot all over the country, running Tea Party candidates who are so far to the right you can't see Middle
America from their porch. And some endangered Democrats will likely see victory in November from theirs if they
understand the public mood and speak to it.
What is that public mood? It can be characterized by a single phrase -- populist anger -- and it cuts across partisan lines.
On the right, it is alloyed with racial anxiety and prejudice. On the left, it is alloyed with tremendous disappointment at
what could have been if we had the kind of bold leadership for which times like these cry out. And among people in the
vast political center, populist anger is alloyed with anxiety and uncertainty -- about their jobs, their homes, and their
children's future.
How to Create a Populist Explosion: A Tragedy in Two Acts
So how did we get here? The story can be told as a tragedy in two acts.
Act I: The GOP Sets the Country on a Course of Economic Destruction and the President Calls for Truth and
Reconciliation without the Truth Part
• A strong economic downturn devolves into a Great Recession, as the stock market crashes and major banks fail.
By October 2008, upper middle class moderate Republicans in the suburbs are so frightened by what's happening
to their assets that they're willing to give Democrats a chance.
• A Republican administration that believes in neither government nor regulation creates a 700 billion bank bailout
with no accountability. Unlike Republicans, who would say ""no"" in a situation like this and let a Great Recession
turn into a Great Depression, Democrats do the right thing, but they don't make it clear from the start that these
are Bush Bailouts and remind Americans, over and over, that the cause of all the bankruptcies is the bankruptcy
of Republican ideology.
• A charismatic young president raises people's hopes and expectations, as he uniquely can. Americans are
frightened, but they are willing and waiting to hear an alternative narrative to ""government is the problem, not the
solution"" and a path back to economic recovery and security.
• The White House refuses to tell the American people three stories they desperately need to hear.
• The first is why the economy has gone into the ditch, and who did it. The president is steadfast in his position that
we should ""look forward, not backward,"" even as the GOP is blocking his every initiative to clean up its mess. As
conservative attacks on him and Democrats increase, he refuses to indict the Republicans in Congress or
President Bush for having destroyed our economy and putting one in eight Americans out of work and one in five
either behind on their mortgage or in the process of having their homes foreclosed by the same bankers who
gambled them away. Why did he need to tell the American people who was responsible for their misery -- and to
repeat it again and again? Because otherwise, if the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression didn't
subside within a year and half, voters would start to associate it with him and his party. This is Neuroscience 101 -
- it's how mental associations are formed. But the president never even uttered George W. Bush's name in his
first year in office, and the first time he did mention Bush was to appoint him, along with former President Clinton,
to co-lead American relief efforts in Haiti. The president doesn't like putting antagonists in any of his stories, but if
forced to, he would cite unnamed ""naysayers,"" ""Washington politics as usual,"" or ""Congress,"" which was
counterproductive given that Congress was held by his party. The guiding belief at the White House implicit in this
messaging strategy was that Americans have a good grasp on economics and good memories:
• The second story the American people needed to hear from the president was why deficit spending is essential
when the economy is spiraling downward. It's not a hard story to tell, even in a sound bite. But one of the best
educators to occupy the Oval Office in decades chose not to educate -- he actually did it once, with prodding, but
never repeated what was a superb explanation --- nor did he remind voters every time his opponents attacked
him for deficit spending that they had left him with a 1.2 trillion dollar deficit on the day he walked into office
because of their unpaid-for tax cuts to millionaires and unpaid-for war on Iraq that called on no one to sacrifice
except our soldiers and their families (and our kids and grandkids, who will be paying off this war for generations).
A year later, with Democrats on the ropes, the president started to tell that story. It was the right move, but
appeared defensive because it hadn't been part of his guiding narrative from the start.
• The third story the president needed to offer was an alternative narrative on government. The president and his
party were about to offer effective government as a solution to multiple problems after 30 years of solid branding
by conservatives since Ronald Reagan about how government is the problem. But the narrative never came.
• The White House and Democratic Congress pass what virtually all economists outside the Goldman Sachs-to-
Washington pipeline consider a half-stimulus that they predict will likely produce half-results. It fulfilled its promise.
But the equally predictable political result was a discrediting of the concept of government intervention to
stimulate the economy in the eyes of the public -- enough to scare off Democratic lawmakers from doing what
they learned about Keynesian economics in intro economics for the indefinite future. Instead of blasting the
Republicans for having hurled the country toward an abyss that would now take drastic measures to avert and
warning the American people that this could easily be the first of two or three trillion-dollar packages that might be

needed to get Americans back to work and to get the gears of the economy grinding again before we could start
returning to the kinds of surpluses Bill Clinton had left the last time a Democrat was in the White House, the
president chose to compromise with a party that was so unpopular when he took office that only 20 percent of
voters at that point would even admit to a pollster that they considered themselves Republicans -- the lowest point
for the GOP since the rise of public opinion polling 50 years earlier.
• The economy continues its free-fall, shedding 700,000 jobs a month. Meanwhile, Democrats don't take the kind of
dramatic steps necessary to stop the bleeding. Americans are becoming desperate, but they remain hopeful that
this new president will turn things around, and that perhaps the jobs provisions of the new ""stimulus"" act will do
cauterize the wound. Meanwhile, the stimulus is being portrayed by Republicans as a mixture of pork and fat, and
no one is effectively answering the charges, creating increasingly negative associations to an act that was never
adequately crafted or sold.
• The logical follow-up to a bill designed to pull the economy out of a ditch is to make such a bill unnecessary in the
future, by attacking Wall Street for having thrown us into crisis and passing strong legislation to rein in the
excesses that created the economic meltdown. This would have sealed the American people's loyalty to the new
president and Congress. (Heading into November, this is, in fact, the most popular piece of legislation the
Democrats have passed, but it took them nearly a year and a half to get there, and by then, neither the president
nor the Democratic Congress enjoyed the good will of the average American.) Instead, the same banks that
received bailouts are foreclosing in record rates on the homeowners whose payroll taxes funded the bailouts but
don't seem to get the same kind of attention to their needs from the federal government. Adding insult to injury,
the banks double and triple credit card interest rates to as high as 30 percent, including on people's existing credit
card debt -- while continuing to receive no-interest loans from the federal government.
• Despite talk of accountability, no one is fired (except one auto executive), virtually no one is prosecuted or even
investigated as far as anyone knows, and banks that received bailouts flaunt record bonuses.
Act II: An Anemic Economy Meets an Anemic Health Care Plan
• The public has been clamoring for health care reform. Over 40 million people don't have health insurance at all,
and the 85 percent of voters who do have health care have seen their costs double during the Bush years at the
same time as real income has declined. Effective narratives on health care are widely available that win by a 2:1
margin against the toughest Harry-and-Louise anti-reform language from the other side. The opposition knows it,
as evident in a leaked memo by Republican wordsmith Frank Luntz, who warns that this will be an uphill climb for
opponents of reform, who would do well to accept some major elements of it.
• But instead of using any of the well-tested narratives that were highly effective during the campaign or devising
any new ones of its own, the administration decides to try to ""sell"" health care without a narrative. (I wrote about
this in detail a year ago and will not repeat that history here, except in telegraphic form.) The president refuses to
state where he stands on any of the substantive debates about health reform for a year, such as whether we
should have a ""public option"" (a term so ill-conceived it's hard to believe the public supported it anyway; imagine
the support it might have received if it had been called instead ""the one health care plan the health insurance
companies don't get to control""). Instead, the White House uses phrases such as ""bending the cost curve"" while
conservatives flood the airwaves with evocative phrases such as ""government takeover,"" ""a bureaucrat between
you and your doctor,"" and ""death panels.""
• Instead of using Big Pharma and the health insurance industry as the villains of the health care story, which would
explain why we need an overhaul rather than a Band-Aid, the White House once again offers a story without
protagonists or antagonists, and cuts secret deals with both industries that become public.
• Over interminable months of trying to get the votes of the same Republicans who fought against Medicare for
seniors for 30 years until the program was just too popular to keep attacking it and who are still trying to gut Social
Security despite its popularity, the public then watches what George Will describes as the ""serial bribery"" of
Republican and Democratic Senators alike, as each gets to take his or her turn as the 60th vote.
• At the 11th hour, as a compromise plan is finally going to pass, the president nixes the idea of a Medicare-like
alternative Americans can choose over a health-insurance industry plan if they so desire, despite 60 percent of
even swing voters wanting it included in the bill.
• Instead of being the signature bill that demonstrates both that Democrats can govern effectively and that
government can be a force for good for working and middle class Americans (who have just been told that the
better plans they've negotiated or been offered for years by their employers are ""Cadillacs"" that are going to be
taxed out of existence), the entire process proves to the average American that government can't do anything
right and scares moderate Democrats away from voting for any other bill that would ever put them on the record
supporting government or spending.
• ""Government"" hits an all-time low in the polls, matching the popularity of big corporations, CEOs, and bailouts.
• Populist anger emerges as the primary emotion across the political spectrum, and the president's job approval
with swing voters drops into the high thirties.

• Following the conventional wisdom, Democrats return to their all-too-familiar defensive crouch, and conclude that
when in trouble, tack right. On health care, the president and his Cabinet fan out all over television to ""reassure""
the public on health care that abortion won't be covered (thanks for the reassurance, but most of us didn't find that
reassuring), that domestic partners won't be covered, and that immigrants won't be covered. None of these issues
needed to be conceded. (I know this because I tested messages on them, and well- messaged progressive
positions on them would have boosted the popularity of the bill with swing voters.)
• The White House starts adopting failed conservative policies and talking points that leave the public utterly
confused about where the president, and by extension, his party, stands on the central issues of the day. The
president talks about cutting deficits and increasing spending in the same breath, using the metaphor of families
tightening their belt in tough times, which only strengthens resolve against stimulating a faltering economy;
pledges support for massively expanding offshore drilling and ""clean coal"" (which doesn't exist, by the way) in a
speech on climate change; and sends in 1200 additional National Guards to Arizona as an apparent reward for
passing ""No Latino Left Behind,"" while publicly objecting to the legislation.
• The underlying psychological assumption of these moves is that if you mix policies from the right and left in equal
parts, you win the center. In fact, no one has ever won the center that way. It appears weak, opportunistic, and
incoherent to the average swing voter, which is particularly problematic at a time when people in the center
desperately want to know that their leaders have a vision and a coherent plan for what to do (which is why both
FDR and Ronald Reagan were so effective in moving voters in the center). It doesn't win any votes on the right.
But it does have one predictable effect: It sucks the motivation out of your base, who feel demoralized and
betrayed (if they're part of the ""professional left"") or less likely to vote (if they're average voters who don't follow
politics carefully but just don't feel very enthusiastic anymore, even if they don't really know why).
• Capping it all off, the BP disaster occurs two weeks after the president has adopted the ""drill here, drill now,"" ""all
of the above"" position of the Republican Party and the oil companies. This could have been the perfect
opportunity to go on the offensive, contrast what Democrats stand for (common sense, protection of our safety,
the land we leave our children, and key American industries and jobs, and sticking up for ordinary Americans
against big businesses and their lobbyists) with what Republicans stand for; and connect the dots between what
happened on Wall Street (with regulators owned and operated by the companies they were supposed to regulate)
and what happened in the Gulf (where precisely the same thing happened). Instead, the administration finds itself

competing with China's wind and solar energy programs, then we'll eliminate the tax breaks that lead to dysfunctional
investments in 19th century fuels and have a public-private partnership with companies that will create the clean, safe
fuels of the 21st century and the millions of good American jobs that will follow.
That's what Democrats stand for. It's time they said it.

The Senator called to ask me to raise the Egyptian custody case of the mother absconding w her children from the US

I'd like to have a letter to Mubarak prepared outlining the facts that I could discuss and leave w him, assuming any of

Let me try this again.
Robert Pape is a top strategic thinker from U of Chicago who is best known for his empirical work showing a strong
correlation between suicide terrorism and occupation by foreign troops. In his new work he is proposing a grand
strategy of off-shore/on-shore balancing. Below is the elevator version, or at least an academic's version of the elevator
version. What is interesting is how closely it tracks with our emphasis on civilian power and the need for a smaller
military due to budget constraints. If you want more the attached one-page proposal outlines a 3-year series of steps to
apply this proposal to Afghanistan.
""An Alternative Security Strategy. Off-shore/on-shore balancing seeks to achieve America's core national security
objectives through a combination of over-the-horizon (""off-shore"") military power and in-region (""on-shore"") economic
and political power. Off-shore/on-shore balancing is an alternative to advancing U.S. security goals through the
deployment of large ground forces overseas, already problematic and likely to become even more so as economic
challenges continue and chronic resentment deepens. Off-shore/on-shore balancing relies on naval, air, and rapidly
deployable ground forces in combination with on-site economic and political support for local partners to secure
America's interests in combating terrorism and achieving other key national security goals, particularly in the Middle
East and Asia.""

Dear Anne-Marie,
As we discussed during your salon dinner with Steve Clemons at Nora's, I am developing a practical strategy of ""off-
shore/on-shore balancing"" that would involve key USG agencies.
As the attached proposal explains, the new strategy is substantially different from previous historical constructs in the
literature on American grand strategy and offers important advantages to improve our position in Afghanistan and other
regions in the world in the coming years.
Going forward, I would like make sure I have State's views correct. If you and your staff could meet with me later next
week, this would greatly help.
I look forward to further discussion.

ZAGREB (AP) - Serbia's president will lay wreaths at the mass grave of Croats slain by Serbs during the 1991 war,
becoming the first Serbian leader to pay his respects to the victims of a massacre that remains a potent symbol of
wartime brutality.
Boris Tadic and his Croatian counterpart, Ivo Josipovic, on November 4 will also honor 18 Serbs killed by Croats in a
nearby village.
The visit to Ovcara, a pig farm near the eastern city of Vukovar where more than 200 Croat prisoners of war and
civilians were executed, is a ""profoundly symbolic act,"" said Josko Paro, Josipovic's foreign policy adviser.

Special investigation: How Blair rescued Palestine
deal worth $200m to his Um-a-year paymasters
By David Rose
Last updated at 12:42 AM on 12th September 2010
Tony Blair mounted an intense political lobbying campaign to rescue a struggling mobile-phone business owned by a client of the bank
that pays him a £2 million annual salary.
The firm, Wataniya, had already built a brand-new network in the Israeli-occupied Palestinian West Bank. But it almost collapsed before
launching its service, jeopardising a £450 million investment, because Israel's government was refusing to let it use the frequencies it
needed to operate. Acting in his capacity as the international Middle East peace envoy, Mr Blair helped to save the company by
spending months putting pressure on Israel's prime minister and his colleagues in a bid to change their minds.
An investigation by The Mail on Sunday has revealed:
• Mr Blair spoke of the need to get Wataniya up and running in order to boost the Palestinian economy. However JP Morgan,
the American investment bank that employs him as a consultant, has a financial stake in Wataniya through Wataniya's owner,
the Qatari firm Qtel, which is an important client of JP Morgan.
• Financial documents show that back in 2007, JP Morgan had been one of four 'mandated lead arrangers' of a $2 billion loan
with which Qtel bought Wataniya from its original Kuwaiti owners. Last year, the bank joined a syndicate that lent Qtel a further
$500 million, and became a 'lead arranger' for a Qtel bond issue which raised yet another $1.5billion.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05772350 Date: 08/31/2015
In these deals, JP Morgan would have been paid many millions of pounds in fees, and if the loans had gone bad, could have been
exposed to substantial losses. 'Its original exposure was probably around $200 million,' one Wall Street expert said yesterday.
Last night a bank spokesman refused to comment, or to disclose any further details. He did not deny that Qtel was a significant JP
Morgan client. A spokesman for Mr Blair said he had no knowledge of any connection between JP Morgan and Qtel.
Mr Blair's lobbying campaign also helped to enrich the family of the Palestinian Authority president, Mahmoud Abbas — a central figure
in the search for Middle East peace. A firm run by his son Tarek has secured a lucrative contract to provide advertising for
Wataniya. Mr Blair's envoy role — for which, as he has often boasted, he is not paid
a salary — has now been enhanced.
Earlier this month, Mr Abbas, Mr Blair and the most important man he lobbied, Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, sat down
together in Washington with President Obama to begin new direct peace talks.
Last night Mr Blair faced calls to publish full details of the myriad business interests that have netted him a personal fortune estimated
to be at least £15 million since he left office.
He is paid not only by JP Morgan but also by the insurance giant Zurich, and his own private consulting firm, Tony Blair Associates,
counts among its clients the royal families of Abu Dhabi and Kuwait.
A frequent visitor to Libya, he has used his personal friendship with the dictator Colonel Gaddafi to explore business opportunities there
on behalf of JP Morgan.
David Davis, the senior backbench Tory MP, said: 'There are now clear questions about how he has used his powers as a peace envoy
and whether that has benefited his commercial sponsors.
'He must now put all his financial affairs into the public domain. Only then can we be sure he has behaved in an appropriate manner.'
Mr Blair was appointed an envoy on leaving Downing Street in June 2007. He represents the 'Quartet' — the United Nations, the US, the
EU and Russia.
His special area of responsibility is the Palestinian economy.
With ten rooms permanently booked at Jerusalem's most expensive hotel, the American Colony, at an annual cost of £1.1 million, he
spends a few days there each month.
As The Mail on Sunday reported last year, many Palestinian businessmen say his achievements have been limited. Projects he has
loudly supported — such as an international business park near the holy city of Hebron — have come to nothing.
'But Wataniya is the great exception,' one leading West Bank entrepeneur said yesterday. 'Indeed, until he finally managed to sort it out
at the end of last year, it was difficult to get him to engage with anything else.'
When Mr Blair arrived in the Middle East in 2007, there was only one mobile firm, Jawwal, operating in the Palestinian Occupied
Territories, Gaza and the West Bank. But Wataniya had already purchased licences for £313 million from Mr Abbas's Palestinian
Authority to provide a competing service.
In July 2008, Mr Blair brokered what Wataniya thought was a cast-iron deal with Israel to make the frequencies it needed available. In
order to provide a modern 3G service to include mobile intemet, Wataniya had been seeking a bandwidth of 4.8 megahertz.
On the strength of this agreement, it continued to build mobile-phone masts, switching centres and other installations it needed to
operate, spending a further £100 million.
It was set to launch in June last year. Meanwhile, amid fierce local controversy, Wataniya managed to secure special additional loans
from a US government programme that had been set up to help Palestinian farmers and small businesses — despite the backing it had
from Qtel and, indirectly, banks such as JP Morgan.
Launching this programme in 2007, the State Department said it was aimed at 'an olive grower who wants to expand operations, a
young person with a small information technology company, or someone who wants to hire neighbours to produce and export
Palestinian embroidery' — not a £450 million mobile network.
The US loans to Wataniya, though worth a relatively modest £11 million, deprived other enterprises of them.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05772350 Date: 08/31/2015
Critics pointed to the fact that involved with Wataniya were leading members of the Palestinian elite around Mr Abbas. Its Palestine
chairman is Mohammad Mustafa — his financial adviser and closest associate, who accompanies him on virtually every foreign trip.
'In the meetings he had with the Prime Minister, he brought it up time
and time again, and kept pushing, pushing.'
In the late spring of 2009, Mr Blair's frequency deal unravelled. Claiming.that the Palestinian Authority had failed to fulfil unspecified
commitments, Israel refused to release the necessary bandwidth. Wataniya teetered on the brink of collapse as first the June and then
a second October launch date, came and went, with the network still inoperative.
Alan Richardson, a Scottish engineer who had already set up a mobile network in Iraq, was Wataniya's Palestine chief executive until
June this year.
'We invested according to a business plan that was based on false promises,' he told me last October. We cannot meet our subscriber
targets with the frequencies they are offering.'
However, Mr Blair was furiously trying to rescue the company. 'From day one of this problem, he's been very proactive through his role
as Quartet representative,' Mr Richardson said.
A senior Israeli official said last week: 'In the meetings he had with the Prime Minister, he brought it up time and time again, and kept
pushing, pushing.'
One reason the Israelis advanced for not releasing the bandwidth was security — claiming it needed the frequencies for military
communications. Another Israeli source confirmed that Mr Blair repeatedly raised the matter in meetings with Israel's defence minister,
Ehud Barak.
Mr Blair made several public statements about the Wataniya frequency dispute, and did not mention JP Morgan at all.
'If we cannot get the proper frequency and it cannot go forward then we don't have proper competition on mobile telephony and we
don't get the investment and jobs,' he said after the first launch was cancelled in June 2009.
'It may seem a small thing in one sense but it's very important for the Palestinian economy.'
Finally, after Qtel threatened legal action, Mr Blair got his way. Although Israel agreed to release only 3.8 megahertz at first, local
sources say it has promised to expand this to 4.8 megahertz once Wataniya has 350,000 customers.
Wataniya launched on November 10, with Mr Blair at the opening ceremony. He said it proved that 'Palestine is open for business'.
Earlier this year, Mr Blair singled out the affair in a report he wrote on his envoy work to the Commons' Foreign Affairs Committee.
'Wataniya's launch is overdue, but extremely welcome,' he wrote, '[it] means the completion of a key milestone in the economic reform
and state building agenda ...Wataniya is an example of a flagship project, which has a significant impact on people's perceptions and
hopes for what a lasting peace might bring.'
Yesterday The Mail on Sunday asked Mr Blair's spokesman Matthew Doyle whether he had declared the bank's interest in his meetings
with the Israelis.
He replied in an email, saying only: 'Tony Blair raised Wataniya at the request of the Palestinian Authority in his role as Quartet
Representative. He has no knowledge of any connection between QTel and JP Morgan and has never discussed the issue with JP
Morgan nor have they ever raised it with him. Any suggestion that he raised it for any reason other than the one stated to help the
Palestinians or that in some way he has benefited from Wataniya is untrue and defamatory.'
Critics Of the Wataniya mobile- phone project backed so strongly by Tony Blair claim it is marred by a longstanding feature of the
Palestinian scene — cronyism, in which close associates of the ruling Fatah party leadership somehow manage to derive lucrative
benefits.
In the case of Wataniya, the link could hardly be closer — for one big beneficiary of the firm's investments is none other than Tarek
Abbas, the son of the Palestinian Authority president, Mahmoud Abbas.
American-educated Tarek runs Sky, the West Bank's biggest advertising agency. Last year, it was awarded a contract to be Wataniya's
lead advertising agent, with both a monthly retainer and further payments for individual campaigns.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05772350 Date: 08/31/2015
Palestinian business sources say that its work for Wataniya has been worth approximately £700,000 in the past 12 months — almost
certainly, the biggest advertising 'spend' in Palestine.
Meanwhile, businessman Firas Nasruddin, a friend of both Tarek and his father, owns Hemaya, a security company staffed by men in
sunglasses and black uniforms, some of whom are former fighters against Israel in groups such as the AI-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades.
Others are former Palestinian Authority police.
Hemaya has a contract to provide security for Wataniya personnel and installations.
It also serves several other firms that are supported by the Palestine Investment Fund, a large pot of money that is meant to be used to
benefit the Palestinian people.
The fund has a 43 per cent stake in Wataniya. President Abbas's chief adviser Mohammad Mustafa is chairman and CEO of the fund,
and chairman of Wataniya.
Wataniya's spokesman, Mohammad Nasser said last night he could not answer any questions about how the Sky and Hemaya
contracts were awarded until next week, while Tarek Abbas's lawyer — who usually speaks on his behalf — could not be reached.
In an interview last year, Wataniya's former Palestine chief, Scot Alan Richardson, said there had been 'a straightforward contract
process that went through all the normal procedures', adding that Sky and Hemaya had been given their deals because they
represented 'best price, best quality'.
Wataniya, he said, operated in a 'fair and transparent manner'.
Nevertheless, the outcome means that as Tony Blair takes part in the renewed search for a peace deal, both sides will know that his
support for Wataniya has produced sizeable benefits for President Abbas's family and friends.

JERUSALEM (AP) - Prime Minister Netanyahu says Israel wants to keep its troops on the eastern border of a future
Palestinian state. Palestinians reject the idea and have proposed an international force along the West Bank's border
with Jordan as part of a peace deal. Netanyahu told U.S. Jewish leaders in a conference call on September 20 that ""the
only force that can be relied on to defend the Jewish people is the Israeli Defense Force."" Netanyahu says an
international force can't ensure Israel's security. He fears Palestinian militants will attack Israel from within a Palestinian
state if Israeli troops are withdrawn from the West Bank-Jordan border. Palestinian President Abbas maintains that an
Israeli troop presence would infringe upon Palestinian sovereignty.

Please Pass to the Secretary
Madame Secretary,
A shoot out occurred on August 20 in front of the American School in Monterrey (AFSM), resulting in the death of two
bodyguards. An investigation is continuing into the details, but our understanding at this point is that it was an
attempted kidnapping targeting the relatives of a local business executive. While it does not appear that U.S. families
were targeted, the sharp increase in kidnapping incidents in the Monterrey area, and this event in particular, present a
very high risk to the families of U.S. citizens who might be become incidental victims.
U.S. security and law enforcement personnel have engaged local and federal security officials to seek their help on
understanding the immediate risks and measures that can be taken. I have urged U.S. families at the Consulate in
Monterrey not to send their children to school in the coming days while we review the events that took place on August
20. We also are advising U.S. citizens in the area that we have urged Consulate personnel not to send their children to
school while we complete this security review.
I am sure that the warden notice will lead to a rash of press reports on U.S. concerns about security in Monterrey. More
broadly, if the government cannot get the kidnappings in Monterrey under control, that may affect our ability to
function in Monterrey. I have advised Secretary Espinosa of this, and have sought her help as well to address consulate
security.
Consulate personnel are currently on ""authorized departure"" and have the option to send their families to a U.S.
location. Pat Kennedy is in close touch on these matters.

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Pakistan will only re-open a supply route for coalition troops in Afghanistan once public anger
over NATO incursions eases and security improves, the foreign ministry spokesman said October 3.
Militants threatened more attacks on tankers carrying fuel to Afghanistan through routes in Pakistan to avenge the
incursions.
""Unless the reaction cools down and we make sure that the supply line is secured, we cannot reopen it,"" Foreign
Ministry spokesman Abdul Basit told Reuters.
Angered by repeated incursions by NATO helicopters over the past week, Pakistan blocked a supply route for NATO
troops in Afghanistan after one such strike killed three Pakistani soldiers on September 30 in the northwestern Kurram
region.

USS IWO JIMA DEPLOYS TO HAITI AS TROPICAL STORM APPROACHES
MIAMI - U.S. Southern Command directed the amphibious ship USS Iwo Jima (LHD 7) to steam toward Haiti today in
preparation for the forecasted arrival of tropical storm Tomas later this week.
Iwo Jima will deploy to Haiti from Suriname, where it arrived Thursday on its final country visit for Continuing Promise
2010, a four-month, humanitarian civic assistance deployment to eight nations in the Caribbean region. The ship is
scheduled to arrive in Haiti later this week.
Large amphibious ships, like Iwo Jima, resemble small aircraft carriers and include the ability to support helicopter and
landing craft operations to quickly move personnel and cargo, making it an ideal platform to support humanitarian-relief
missions on short notice.
A crew of 1,600 military and civilian medical, engineering, aviation, logistical and other support personnel are embarked
aboard Iwo Jima, including U.S. Navy engineers, a contingent of 500 Marines with logistical-support expertise,
volunteers from the U.S. Public Health Service and various non-governmental organizations (NG0s), as well as medical,
dental and engineering professionals from Europe, North America and South America.
Eight CH-46 Sea Knight, medium-lift, dual-rotor helicopters; two MH-60 Knight Hawk helicopters and two amphibious
landing craft units (ICU's) are on Iwo Jima to support the ship's operations.
Iwo Jima is a Wasp-class amphibious ship capable of speeds in excess of
20 knots that can provide robust ship-to-shore, as well as shore-to-shore logistics support during contingencies ranging
from traditional military operations to humanitarian and disaster-relief missions.
Because of the Caribbean region's history of severe-weather events during the peak months of the hurricane season, the
ship has remained in the area throughout its present deployment, ready to support U.S.
disaster relief efforts when directed.
Iwo Jima was in Port-de-Paix, Haiti, from July 24 through Aug. 3. It was the first stop on CP10 and the crew provided
medical assistance to more than 4,000 Haitian citizens, performed 32 surgeries, completed six engineering projects, and
delivered 231 pallets of humanitarian-assistance supplies donated by NG0s.
In September 2008, the amphibious ship USS Kearsarge deployed to Haiti to support U.S. relief efforts after a succession
of storms (Fay, Gustav, Hanna and Ike) devastated the country. Kearsarge provided robust air and sealift support,
delivering 3.3 million pounds of food, water and other aid to communities impacted by the disasters.

from traditional military operations to humanitarian and disaster-relief missions.
Because of the Caribbean region's history of severe-weather events during the peak months of the hurricane season, the
ship has remained in the area throughout its present deployment, ready to support U.S.
disaster relief efforts when directed.
Iwo Jima was in Port-de-Paix, Haiti, from July 24 through Aug. 3. It was the first stop on CP10 and the crew provided
medical assistance to more than 4,000 Haitian citizens, performed 32 surgeries, completed six engineering projects, and
delivered 231 pallets of humanitarian-assistance supplies donated by NG0s.
In September 2008, the amphibious ship USS Kearsarge deployed to Haiti to support U.S. relief efforts after a succession
of storms (Fay, Gustav, Hanna and Ike) devastated the country. Kearsarge provided robust air and sealift support,
delivering 3.3 million pounds of food, water and other aid to communities impacted by the disasters.

Associates** about my finally hanging up my own shingle after all these years and at a ripe young age, with
a 12 year-old and a 5 year-old to pay college tuition for to I cant even state the age I will be in writing when
I write my last tuition check.
I am quite concerned *even though the reporter for the American Lawyer, David Levine, seems to be a nice
young man (which makes me even more concerned • sometimes the nicest ones can burn you the worst.
*(You, of all people, should know!)
I have given David Levine, the American Lawyer reporter, a list of friends, business, personal, and political, to
call. *I fully anticipate there will be personal and professional mean-spirited shots at me in the story *that is
inevitable • especially from those attorneys who still don*t accept that what I do is unusual as well as the
hateful rightwing (and perhaps even more from the left, who don*t like my *Purple Nation* approach and
my effort to help make bad countries better!!!).
To try to balance the cheap shots, I have asked a variety of people from Ds and Rs and in between to talk to the
reporter about me. *Ted Olsen did and said great things. So did Mike McCurry and Karl Rove (!!!). *Even
President Clinton and President Bush, I am told, may weigh in with nice written statements about their old
friend from Yale days. *And believe it or not, even Senator McCain called the reporter personally on his cell
phone to tell him how much he appreciated my bipartisan *Purple Nation* approach to politics (inspired, of
course, by my friend the great former Junior Senator from New York, Hillary Clinton, whom my friend
Lindsey Graham once told me was the nicest and most effective person in the U.S. Senate!).
My message that I hope gets reflected in the article is that I and my law firm offer unique multi-disciplinary
capabilities in law, media and politics: *first, *traditional legal advice and litigation, which allows me to get
all the facts, good and bad, under the crucial protection of attorney-client privilege; media experience,
understanding that reporters need facts and you have to fight to get them to focus on facts, not innuendo, win
the trust, so that they will give the person for whom I am advocating a break and actually try to be fair and
accurate; and finally, politics and legislative strategies, which often helps clients solve litigation solutions
where the courts are not working. *You can see where the shots may come from* lawyers who feel
threatened by my unusual multi-disciplinary approach; public relations firms, who don*t thinks lawyers
should talk to the media; and lobbyists, who think they should be left alone and not be bothered about being
careful with the facts when approaching an elected official.
So my question to you, good friend Hillary, is:
Would you be willing to talk personally to the reporter? *I assume the answer will no * since I can see that
that might be inappropriate. *And if that is your answer, I completely understand.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05771340 Date: 08/31/2015
So my second question is, if the first one is no: *Would you be willing to have Philippe or Cheryl issue a
statement to the reporter, David Levine, on your behalf about your opinion of my professional skills and/or our
friendship over the years?
Please please please * note there are *three please*: *Do not be bashful or concerned about saying no to
my request. As you can see, I have a number of people who have talked to the reporter or, in the case of
President Clinton and President Bush, who may be giving written statements.
I wasnot even going to ask you for that reason since I didn*t want you to feel badly if you have to say no.
*But then again. The honest to goodness truth is, : *Aside from Carolyn, my four children, and my
immediate family, I consider you to be the best friend and the best person I have met in my long life. You
know that from the dedication and appreciation of you I have always felt and expressed to you over four
decades. So that is why your comments would mean a lot to me, even if just a written statement.
BUT: *one more please (#4) • if it feels inappropriate to you as Secretary of State or for any other reason to
be in a quote about me on a personal or professional level, I fully understand.
Thanks for just considering this, my good friend Hillary. If the answer is yes, just tell me know by return
email (or have someone call my assistant, Maddie Melendez,
who the reporter should contact at your office, *and when. *Unfortunately the deadline is within the next
two weeks.
Best and warmest regards,
Lanny

This is from Fr. Borys Gudziak, the wonderful priest you met in Lviv. He gave you a tour of the Cathedral and you had a
wonderful chat with him at the time. Since then, much progress has been made there. He became head of the new
Ukrainian Catholic University and has really come in to his own as a respected leader and scholar.
Unfortunately, his situation and that of the Catholic community and academic freedom has come under siege since
Yanokovich became president. I have a series of emails from the US Ukrainian community, in addition to this email
directly from Gudziak, They are alarmed about developments. I've been in touch with John Tefft and sent him
everything. He is aware of recent events.
I will make a folder of the correspondence for you since the community here and in Ukraine sees you as their champion.

in defense of democracy and even western Ukrainian politicians are capitulating under pressure. So is business. The
approach of the new authorities is quick and systematic. Top and middle positions in all spheres of government,
administration, state security, police have been rapidly changed and are effectively moving in on the freedom of the
press and discourse.
Our students are scared.
Some are active, but some fear for the university, that it may loose accreditation. A father and his daughter-student
came to my office in a state of anxiety.
Some students are afraid to blog and post comments because they fear that they will be traced and that their parents
will loose their jobs.
There is clear evidence from one of our banks that the authorities are beginning to dig into the question of our
finances. Provocations, moral defamation, planting of drugs and weapons in student residences as happened in 2004
before the election could be next.
The most effective defense is speaking out.
I am grateful for your solicitude and wanted to ask for two things.
1 To ask the Secretary of State to bring this to the attention of the president and vice president and to do what she
can in our defense.
2. to help us get the story to some of the main media outlets: New York Times, Washington Post, Wall Street Journal,
CNN, etc. One story by any of these for us and for the people in Ukraine that have the courage to speak the truth is
invaluable.
We have had some great support already. But I have a sense that this adventure is only beginning and we have to be
ready for everything.
Please pass on my respect to Secretary Clinton.
May God bless you!

NEW YORK (AP) - Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad says ""the future belongs to Iran,"" and challenged the United
States to accept that his country has a major role in the world. The comment came in an hour-long interview with The
Associated Press on the first day of his visit to the United States to attend the annual General Assembly at the United
Nations. He restated that his government does not want an atomic bomb and is only seeking peace and a nuclear-free
world. He gave no indication when Iran would resume talks on its nuclear program and said any anti-nuclear sanctions
against his government would have no effect on his government's policies. Appearing calm and self-assured, he said he
was pleased by the release of American hiker Sarah Shourd.

Subject: (Sydney Morning Herald) Abbas ready for direct talks with Israel
Palestinian President Abbas said he was ready for direct negotiations with Israel, following Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu's accusations that the Palestinians are avoiding the talks. ""We are ready to hold direct peace negotiations
with Israel,"" Abbas told reporters after talks with Jordan's King Abdullah II in Amman. ""We have negotiated with Israeli
governments before, more than once. Why would we avoid such talks? We are not.""
Netanyahu told the parliamentary committee on foreign affairs and defense earlier July 26 the Palestinians were trying
to sneak out of direct negotiations while Israel was ready to start them ""immediately."" ""We have an understanding with
the Americans that we need to move now, without any delay, to direct negotiations, but in response, we have a clear
Palestinian attempt to avoid this process,"" Netanyahu said. ""They are trying to stall and to sneak away from direct
negotiations and to cause the Arab League to shackle the talks.""
Netanyahu's remarks come just days ahead of a meeting in Cairo between Abbas and the Arab League at which the
Palestinian leader will discuss the indirect talks with Israel, which began in May, and will also address the pressing
question of a shift to direct negotiations.
Abbas has repeatedly said he would not move to direct talks without tangible progress on the key issues of borders and

Jake —
Here is an update for the Secretary on the status of the non-finance components of the G-20 Seoul Summit
declaration. Sherpa, Finance Deputy, and Working Group discussions are ongoing on the financial issues (and
the text is very close hold) — so we don't have much on that. The following represents what is likely to be close
to the final outcome on the other issues.
• Fossil Fuel Subsidies: The text will reaffirm the Pittsburgh Summit commitment to phase out over the
medium term inefficient fossil fuel subsidies. It will also take up the issue of fuel price volatility; this
portion will focus on improving the quality of fuel data (inventories, storage capacity, refining, etc.) and
greater dialogue between fuel producers and consumers.
• Climate Change: The G-20 will rededicate their efforts to discuss climate change issues under the
UNFCCC process with the aim of reaching a global and comprehensive framework post 2012. The text
will also focus on the upcoming COP16 conference in Mexico.
• Trade: The G-20 will continue to collectively push for the conclusion of the Doha Round, calling for
intensified engagement in 2011.
• Development: The Communiqué will contain a multi-year development action plan that focuses on nine
pillars: infrastructure, human resource development, trade, private investment and job creation, food
security, financial inclusion, fiscal integrity and domestic resource mobilization, and ""growth with
resilience.""
• Anti-Corruption: The G-20 will endorse an Anti-Corruption Action Plan to spur action under the UN
Convention Against Corruption; address transnational bribery; deny corrupt persons access to the global
financial system; and further engage the private sector.
I will be happy to provide more details on any one of these items if the Secretary would like — and will report
on the discussions and final outcome.

Karzai's Chief of Staff, Omar Daudzai, called Annie this morning to relay that President Karzai did sign the Afghan Peace
and Reintegration Program decree, and that GIRoA will make a public announcement to that effect this evening (Kabul
time).
We do not yet have a copy of the signed decree (we are working to get a copy for our LES to translate, however, it is not
yet available from any of our sources). Based on previous drafts, we believe the decree will:

• Establish the High Peace Council (HPC) called for at the National Consultative Peace Jirga. The HPC will provide
political and strategic leadership to the Afghan Peace and Reintegration Program (APRP);
• Establish the bureaucratic and organizational structure and space for the reintegration Joint Secretariat,
including appointment of an interim CEO (presumably Stanekzai — although his future long-term tenure in the
job is unclear).
• Provide clear instructions to line ministries to support reintegration and allocate representatives to the Joint
Secretariat;
• Provide clear instructions to sub-national officials to support reintegration and to establish provincial and district
reintegration committees in accordance with the interim guidance released by the Afghan National Security
Council in April;
• Define a process to absorb Peace through Strength (PTS) and other reintegration structures (potentially
Disarmament of Illegal Armed Groups — DIAG) under the national and provincial structures of the APRP; and
• Most importantly, give the requisite Presidential imprimatur to the program.
A second decree should be issued prior to or concurrent with the Kabul Conference appointing the members of the High
Peace Council and a permanent CEO for the APRP.
As soon as we have a copy of the decree and can confirm its contents, we will send a Front Channel cable; in the
meantime, we are informing the Desk, SRAP and General Petraeus' staff that the decree has been signed.

See email chain below. We need to get this info into the system particularly in EUR and the Gulf region but we need to
do so carefully and as David points out with a great deal of sensitivity for the families.
For example when I was in Jeddah I met with a group of prominent Islamic scholars
several of whom were leading Saudi doctors. We talked about ways they could reach out to their colleagues in Pakistan
and Afghanistan. We should get them this information and see if we can enlist them in this effort. Walter will know how
to reach them. David will advise on best way to coordinate with families.

BAGHDAD (AP) — Iraq's Prime Minister will travel to Iran and Jordan to seek support for his bid to win a second term more
than seven months after national elections. His adviser Ali al-Moussawi said the prime minister will assure the
neighboring states that none of Iraq's major political constituencies will be excluded from a new government if they back
his second term. Al-Maliki will meet Jordan's King Abdullah II on October 17. He will meet with Iran's President
Ahmadinejad and the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei in Tehran on October 18. He will also visit Turkey and Egypt
next week.

Re: British election
First and most important: Do NOT, repeat, NOT, call any prospective winner on either Election Night, May 6, or on the
next day, Friday, May 7. The result will be unclear. It will not be clear, even perhaps by Friday afternoon. Today, the
combined polls show Cameron and the Conservatives ahead but not winning an outright majority. The latest Guardian
poll, out tomorrow, shown me by Alan Rusbridger today, has the Tories falling short of a majority of seats. Even if
Cameron were to win an outright majority, Brown and Labour will attempt to make a deal with Clegg and the Liberal
Democrats. Brown remains as Prime Minister unless the Tories win outright, which take a long time to determine.
Labour and the Lib-Dems will almost certainly gain about 60 percent of the vote, more or less. Brown will reach out to
Clegg to stay in power. The deal will be that Brown will approve a referendum on proportional representation giving the
LDs much greater representationin future elections. That will spell the end forever of the Tories ever coming to power.
The Tories see the election in apocalyptic terms—and they are not wrong. Brown's weakness heralds the sort of grand

progressive coalition/alliance that Tony imagined but was never able to attempt between Labour and the LDs. Brown
offering the referendum would be the first step toward that. In the case of the Tories falling short of an outright majority
in seats, they will respond as though Brown is acting illegitimately, which he would not be by remaining as PM and
dealing with Clegg. Informed people are already talking of what might begin to unfold on Friday as ""Florida."" The Tories,
backed by the Murdoch press, will attempt to push Labour aside by force majeure—something that will not succeed
under those circumstances. The Murdochs are almost literally going crazy. James Murdoch and hiw wife stormed into
the offices of The Independent, not a Murdoch paper, when the paper endorsed the LDs and confronted the publisher,
screaming in the middle of the newsroom. Murdoch would be a big, big loser if Cameron loses. Another possibile
outcome is that the Conservatives come up just short and attempt their own deal with the DUP to cover the gap in seats.
Shaun is on to this potential, has been talking to Peter Robinson.
No matter what, keep your powder dry until the result is crystal clear. Wait.

War on terror: Obama softened the language, but hardened Muslim hearts
The Obama administration's shift in counterterrorism language sought to bridge the divide with the Muslim world and
soften Americans' fear of Islam. But the new rhetoric hasn't matched policy, and the unintended costs at home and
abroad have been high.
By Stuart Gottlieb <http://www.csmonitor.com/layout/set/print/About/Contact-Us-Feedback>
posted October 14, 2010 at 9:58 am EDT
New Haven, Conn. —
One of the most defining aspects of the Obama administration's counterterrorism strategy has been its effort to change
America's rhetorical approach to the threat of terrorism <http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2009/0129/obama-
redefines-war-on-terror> , particularly Islamic terrorism. ""The language we use matters,"" President Obama told the
Arabic satellite television station Al Arabiya in an interview during his first week in office. Scrubbed were George W.
Bush-era terms like ""war on terrorism,"" ""radical Islam,"" and ""jihadist."" <http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/0901/p03s03-
uspo.html> The White House's 2010 National Security Strategy formally replaced the term ""Islamic terrorism"" with
""violent extremism.""
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05771519 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05771519 Date: 08/31/2015
The purpose of the shift in semantics was two-fold.
First, it aimed to repackage the fight against terrorism as a specific fight against Al Qaeda, not against Islamic extremism,
which Mr. Obama believes contributed to a post-9/11 perception that America was ""at war with Islam."" Indeed, the new
rhetoric <http://www.csmonitor.com/World/G lobal-News/2009/0604/in-fra nce-oba ma-erases-the-us-vs-them-
rhetoric> has gone hand in hand with Obama's outreach to the Muslim world
<http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Middle-East/2009/0605/p06s01-wome.html> to build ""a new partnership based on
mutual respect and mutual interest.""
Second, it was part of a broader effort to soften Americans' fear of Islamic terrorism, which Obama officials believe plays
directly into the hands of extremists.
Language change ineffective
Now it is fair to ask whether Obama's use of language regarding terrorism has proven effective. Startling new polls
suggest it hasn't. The first, by the Brookings Institution in Washington, shows that between May 2009 and May 2010 the
number of Middle Eastern Arabs expressing optimism in Obama's approach toward their region dropped
<http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Global-News/2010/0806/0bama-s-popularity-may-be-down-in-US-but-he-s-even-
less-popular-among-Arabs> from 51 percent to just 16 percent, with those describing themselves as ""discouraged"" by
the Obama presidency rising from 15 percent to 63 percent.
The second, by the Pew Research Center, shows that in August 2010 fewer Americans held a favorable view of Islam (30
percent) than five years earlier during the Bush administration (41 percent), with more Americans (35 percent) saying
Islam encourages violence more than other religions (in 2002, it was 25 percent).
These starkly negative trend lines suggest the limited utility of language in fighting terrorism. Yes, terrorism is a
propaganda-fueled activity — an ongoing battle to win hearts and minds <http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Middle-
East/2009/0603/p06s16-wome.html> and attract new recruits to fight for the cause. And of course the language used in
combating terrorism <http://www.csmonitorcom/USA/Foreign-Policy/2008/0801/p02s01-usfp.html> is vital — the
counterproductive ""smoke 'em out"" rhetoric of the Bush administration <http://www.csmonitor.com/2001/0919/p12s2-
woeu.html> is a case in point.
But if rhetoric does not match policy, or appears to discount or play down threats, the credibility — and thus
effectiveness — of the overall counterterrorism strategy may be undermined. It appears the Obama administration has
dug itself into just such a hole.
Rhetoric doesn't match policy
When looking beyond the nuanced language and appealing promises, what Muslims around the world see is an
administration that has ramped up the war in Afghanistan
<http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2010/0609/0bama-wants-more-money-for-Afghanistan-war.-Will-Congress-
grant-it> ; is killing scores of Muslim civilians with drone strikes <http://www.csmonitor.com/World/terrorism-
security/2010/0915/US-drone-attacks-bombard-Haqqani-network-in-Pakistan> ; continues to hold more than 1,000
Muslim detainees in Guantanamo <http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Topics/Guantanamo>, Bagram, and other prisons;
and maintains seemingly unconditional support of Israel.
This is not to critique these policies, but to point out that they do not match the raised expectations of the Muslim world
and have only muddled Obama's oft-stated goal of turning Muslims toward America and away from extremist
movements.

The price of downplaying the threat
A large price is also being paid domestically for disconnected rhetoric. Despite maintaining nearly all of Bush's hard-line
tactics — the USA Patriot Act <http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2010/0301/0bama-signs-Patriot-Act-extension-
without-reforms> , warrantless surveillance, indefinite detentions — the White House has consistently played down the
threat, even in the face of a clear uptick in terrorism activity.
For example, following the failed 2009 Christmas Day airline bombing
<http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2010/0102/Calling-it-war-Obama-pegs-Christmas-Day-attack-to-Al-Qaeda> ,
Obama described the suspect as an ""isolated extremist,"" despite his ties to Al Qaeda. And the administration's initial
response to the failed May 2010 Times Square bombing <http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/2010/0509/Times-Square-
bombing-Sign-of-desperation-from-Pakistan-Taliban> by an American Muslim trained in Pakistan was to call it a ""one-
off"" event. Attorney General Eric Holder stated <http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Justice/2010/0203/Holder-letter-why-
we-read-Christmas-Day-bomber-his-rights> in congressional testimony that he believed these and other recent Islamic
terror plots were unconnected, and unrelated to radical Islam.
There is little doubt that the administration's unwillingness to speak candidly about Islamic terrorism has taken a toll on
the public's trust. A Gallup poll released last month shows Americans favoring Republicans over Democrats on the issue
of terrorism 55 percent to 31 percent — up from 49 percent to 42 percent last fall.
Time to reverse the trend
Obama entered office promising to fight a smarter and more effective war on terrorism, and in many ways he has. His
instincts to maintain aggressive tactics while toning down inflammatory rhetoric
<http://www.csmonitorcom/2006/0517/p09s01-cojh.html> were sound. Yet his administration seems to have
overlearned a key lesson of the Bush years — that overstating the threat of terrorism
<http://www.csmonitorcom/2007/0418/p04s01-woeu.html> has costs attached. So, too, does rhetoric that
understates the threat, especially when detached from policy.
It is not too late to reverse this troubling trend. The White House can begin by focusing less on overly reassuring rhetoric
— which has not paid dividends at home or abroad — and more on a candid accounting of the threats faced
<http://www.csmonitorcom/2006/0905/p14s02-bogn.html> and the policies employed to confront them.

Subject: (AP) Israel says Arabs agree on Iran threat
TEL AVIV (AP) - Israel's prime minister says newly leaked U.S. diplomatic cables provide clear proof that the Arab world
agrees with his country's assessment that Iran is the chief danger to the Middle East. Benjamin Netanyahu said on
November 29 ""that the greatest threat to peace in the region, if not in the world, has been revealed."" According to the
cables released November 28 by Wikileaks, various Arab countries including Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia and other Gulf
states, have used terms like ""evil"" and ""existential threat"" to describe Iran. Some urged U.S. airstrikes on Iranian nuclear
facilities. Netanyahu said that if Arab leaders would say in public what they say privately ""there might be a
breakthrough.""

Media Highlights: Revelations by WikiLeaks — Turkey is the Epicenter
US Embassy Ankara — Turkey Media Reaction — November 29, 2010 as prepared by the Public Affairs Information
Office
How the US is Playing/Related News
Ankara Is WikiLeaks Epicenter (Hurriyet)
Turkish media is awash in Wikileaks revelations, with most focused on the 7,918 cables - the largest number for any one
country - emanating from the US Embassy in Ankara. All news channels NW and CNN Turk reported that PM Erdogan,
as he departed for Libya on 11/29, told reporters ""let the Wikileaks show what it has and, then, ...we can learn how serious
or unserious these reports are because the credibility of Wikileaks is in question. So, currently we are waiting for them to
print what they have. Then we can make an evaluation and necessary statement."" Pro-government Sabah columnist
Mehmet Barlas asks ""Are Wikileaks Docs More Striking than Reality?"" and opines ""It's hard to understand why the State
Department has panicked this much. After all, this information is gathered from the facts, media, and different
sources. What could remain secret in an information age?"" Ashi Aydintasbas in Miffiyet Over the past year, the AK Party
government had a volatile relationship with the Obama Administration. The documents show that Americans do not see
the government in Ankara as a real ally, and that they have concerns. Unlike the style used in bilateral meetings, a much
tougher language is used backstage. The fact that the Turkish foreign minister knows his interlocutors characterize him as
'dangerous' at a time he's in Washington will stiffen the distrustfulness between the two capitals."" In ""Ankara WikiLeaks
Epicenter,"" mainstream Hurriyefs front page headline report mirrors most Turkish media reports in saying that the
documents show that the US Embassy in Ankara views Turkey ""as a country with divisions in leadership"" and that ""Turkey
cannot be trusted because it was not likely to join the EU and was heading to an Islamist future."" Hurriyet spotlights reports
that purportedly say Turkish Prime Minister Erdogan had ""incompetent"" advisors and was pursuing a secret, Islamist agenda
and that describe him as ""stubborn, workaholic and perfectionist,"" but ""not a tyrant."" Hurriyet concludes that reports indicated
that that the US views Turkish Foreign Minister Davutoglu as an ""exceptionally dangerous"" figure and that ""America had
been alarmed by his aspirations to reassert the influence the Ottoman Empire used to exert on the region."" In ""9/11 of
Diplomacy: WikiLeaks Releases 'Secret State Documents,"" Islamist-oriented Zaman reports that Ankara believes [the high
number of cables from the US Embassy in Ankara] proves Turkey's importance and its diplomatic effectiveness."" In ""The
WikiLeaks Bomb,"" pro-government, Islamist-oriented Yeni Safak reports the WikiLeaks releases contain ""shocking details""

such as the chief of Mossad, Meir Dagan, telling an American official Islam was on the rise in Turkey, and ""asking for how
long the military, the defender of the secular identity, would remain silent."" Other media cover the story as follows:
In its two-page spread, Zaman chronicles details of a FM Davutoglu —A/S Gordon meeting from November 12, 2009 in
which the US side asks Turkey to take a tougher position against Iran if Tehran disregards international pressure, as well
as a February 18, 2010 meeting between U/S of State William Burns and Turkish Foreign Ministry U/S Feridun Sinirlioglu
on Iraq.
In ""Hell Breaks Loose,"" mainstream Vatan focuses on the detailed US reports about Prime Minister Erdogan and AK
Party. The paper notes on its centerfold piece that Ergenekon was closely watched by the US and that US officials were
holding talks with Turkish generals. Both the Turkish government and the Turkish army were under close US
surveillance, notes Vatan.
Pro-government Sabah in ""Turkey Mark in WikiLeaks Documents,"" says the State Department has been waiting for the
Wikileaks release with ""curiosity and fear."" Iran, Azerbaijan and the EU stand on the forefront in documents related to
Turkey, says the paper.
Leftist Taraf in its front page banner headline, ""They Monitored Even Erdogan's Son-in-Law,"" notes ""in the documents,
business connections of PM Erdogan's son-in-law were closely watched by the US. It's claimed that Erdogan rules
Turkey with a group of incapable plotters.""
Mainstream Aksam in ""9/11 of Diplomacy,"" mentions American diplomats find Davutoglu very dangerous and add that
""Turkey, with its axis shifting to East, is heading to an Islamist state.""
Liberal Radikal and most media including the CNN-Turk headline ""9/11 of Diplomacy."" Radikal highlights ""there was a
struggle to prevent Wikileaks from releasing the secret documents but that ""the documents that could put the relations
with the US in trouble have been released anyway.""
In ""Hell Breaks Loose,"" mainstream Vatan focuses on the detailed US reports about Prime Minister Erdogan and AK

surveillance, notes Vatan.
Commentary In Full: ""WikiLeaks Crypto will Cause Crisis in Washington""(Milliyet)
Ashi Aydintasbas in Miffiyet: ""Three elements might cause damage between Ankara and Washington in the WikiLeaks
revelations related to Turkey. First comes the claim that Turkey has helped al-Qaeda. A high level official believes this
claim will not be convincing, because Ankara has proven itself in fighting against al-Qaeda. We recently see a flurry of
news relating Turkey to al-Qaeda. All Turkish officials I have spoken with believe that such reports had been a campaign
against Turkey which was launched right after the Mavi Marmara crisis. The second claim is the US is helping the
PKK. If the WikiLeaks documents reveal a concrete tie between the US and the PKK, it will rock the two countries, further
damaging the image of the US in Turkey. From time to time, the US has allowed Turkey to launch military operations into
northern Iraq, but actually never really fought against the PKK. As a high level official put it, the US never supported the
PKK but it also did not let the organization be destroyed, and kept it as an element of balance. The sources I have talked
to said the leaks could contain information about the contacts of American officers or intelligence members with the PKK
on security or other issues. Another possibility is contacts between Americans and the PKK's Iran wing, PJAK, but it's a
remote possibility that this issue would be mentioned in diplomatic cables rather than intelligence reports. The third claim
is the expressions used in the US State Department cables to define Turkish leaders. Over the past year, the AK Party
government had a volatile relationship with the Obama Administration. The documents show that Americans do not see
the government in Ankara as a real ally, and that they have concerns. Unlike the style used in bilateral meetings, a much
tougher language is used backstage. The fact that the Turkish foreign minister knows his interlocutors characterize him
as 'dangerous' at a time he's in Washington will stiffen the distrustfulness between the two capitals.""

DUBLIN (Reuters) — Ireland's four-year plan to reduce its deficit will be published on November 23, ahead of any
international financial aid package, the Irish Times reported, citing unnamed senior Irish officials. ""The cabinet will meet
November 21 to sign off on the 160-page document which charts how the state will reduce its outgoings,"" the Irish Times
said, adding the publication date had been brought forward so it could be identified as a government-originated plan
rather than one driven by Europe or the IMF. The Irish Times said a separate plan for restructuring the banking sector
was also expected to be finalized November 20-21.

Subject: (AP) Diplomats: Iran expands enrichment facility
VIENNA - (AP) Iran has set up new equipment that will allow it to boost its efficiency at enriching uranium at higher
levels, diplomats said May 14. The move is likely to give the U.S. more leverage with Russia and China in its push for new
UN sanctions on Tehran. Iran's clandestine enrichment activities were discovered eight years ago and have expanded
since to encompass thousands of centrifuges churning out material enriched to 3.5 percent. But despite three sets of
Security Council sanctions meant to enforce demands of a freeze, Tehran moved to a new level in February, when it set
up a small program to produce material enriched to near 20 percent.

An Alliance Larger Than One Issue
By JOSEPH S. NYE Jr.
Cambridge, Mass.
SEEN from Tokyo, America's relationship with Japan faces a crisis. The immediate problem is deadlock over a plan to
move an American military base on the island of Okinawa. It sounds simple, but this is an issue with a long back story
that could create a serious rift with one of our most crucial allies.
When I was in the Pentagon more than a decade ago, we began planning to reduce the burden that our presence places
on Okinawa, which houses more than half of the 47,000 American troops in Japan. The Marine Corps Air Station
Futenma was a particular problem because of its proximity to a crowded city, Ginowan. After years of negotiation, the
Japanese and American governments agreed in 2006 to move the base to a less populated part of Okinawa and to move
8,000 Marines from Okinawa to Guam by 2014.
The plan was thrown into jeopardy last summer when the Japanese voted out the Liberal Democratic Party that had
governed the country for nearly half a century in favor of the Democratic Party of Japan. The new prime minister, Yukio
Hatoyama, leads a government that is inexperienced, divided and still in the thrall of campaign promises to move the
base off the island or out of Japan completely.
The Pentagon is properly annoyed that Mr. Hatoyama is trying to go back on an agreement that took more than a
decade to work out and that has major implications for the Marine Corps' budget and force realignment. Secretary of
Defense Robert Gates expressed displeasure during a trip to Japan in October, calling any reassessment of the plan
""counterproductive."" When he visited Tokyo in November, President Obama agreed to a high-level working group to
consider the Futenma question. But since then, Mr. Hatoyama has said he will delay a final decision on relocation until at
least May.
Not surprisingly, some in Washington want to play hardball with the new Japanese government. But that would be
unwise, for Mr. Hatoyama is caught in a vise, with the Americans squeezing from one side and a small left-wing party
(upon which his majority in the upper house of the legislature depends) threatening to quit the coalition if he makes any
significant concessions to the Americans. Further complicating matters, the future of Futenma is deeply contentious for
Okinawans.
Even if Mr. Hatoyama eventually gives in on the base plan, we need a more patient and strategic approach to Japan. We
are allowing a second-order issue to threaten our long-term strategy for East Asia. Futenma, it is worth noting, is not the
only matter that the new government has raised. It also speaks of wanting a more equal alliance and better relations
with China, and of creating an East Asian community — though it is far from clear what any of this means.
When I helped to develop the Pentagon's East Asian Strategy Report in 1995, we started with the reality that there were
three major powers in the region — the United States, Japan and China — and that maintaining our alliance with Japan
would shape the environment into which China was emerging. We wanted to integrate China into the international

system by, say, inviting it to join the World Trade Organization, but we needed to hedge against the danger that a future
and stronger China might turn aggressive.
After a year and a half of extensive negotiations, the United States and Japan agreed that our alliance, rather than
representing a cold war relic, was the basis for stability and prosperity in the region. President Bill Clinton and Prime
Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto affirmed that in their 1996 Tokyo declaration <http://www.mofa.go.jp/region/n-
america/us/security/security.html> . This strategy of ""integrate, but hedge"" continued to guide American foreign policy
through the years of the Bush administration.
This year is the 50th anniversary of the United States-Japan security treaty. <http://www.mofa.go.jp/region/n-
america/us/q&a/refahtml> The two countries will miss a major opportunity if they let the base controversy lead to
bitter feelings or the further reduction of American forces in Japan. The best guarantee of security in a region where
China remains a long-term challenge and a nuclear North Korea poses a clear threat remains the presence of American
troops, which Japan helps to maintain with generous host nation support.
Sometimes Japanese officials quietly welcome ""gaiatsu,"" or foreign pressure, to help resolve their own bureaucratic
deadlocks. But that is not the case here: if the United States undercuts the new Japanese government and creates
resentment among the Japanese public, then a victory on Futenma could prove Pyrrhic.
Joseph S. Nye Jr., a professor of government at Harvard and the author of ""The Powers to Lead,"" was an assistant
secretary of defense from 1994 to 1995.

Does Thomas Friedman Have to Talk to ""Senior Economic Policy Makers"" to Get So
Many Things Wrong?
Dean Baker is co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington, DC.
Wednesday, 18 August 2010 04:04
Thomas Friedman begins his oiece 1Q(44v by telling readers that: ""over the past few weeks I've had a chance to
speak with senior economic policy makers in America and Germany."" This might lead readers to believe that
he is about to share some great insights that would only be possible for someone with special access to these
senior economic policy makers.
Readers with this expectation will be seriously disappointed. There is nothing here that is more insightful than
what can be found on the Washington Post's editorial pages on an average workday. Friedman rehashes the
usual cliches, with the usual lack of thought. In doing so, he gets both the story of the recent past and the
present seriously wrong.
Starting with the past, he badly misrepresents the prior business cycle:
""we've just ended more than a decade of debt-fueled growth during which we borrowed money from China to
give ourselves a tax cut and more entitlements but did nothing to curtail spending or make long-term
investments in new growth engines.""
The main problem facing the U.S. economy of the last decade was a lack of demand. This was in large part due
to the fact that China lent to us. China's lending was its policy of propping up the value of the dollar in order to
maintain its export market in the United States. (At the start of the decade, the Clinton administration had also
tried to promote an over-valued dollar.) The over-valued -U.S. dollar made imports from China and other
countries very cheap in the United States and made our exports expensive in other countries. This led to a large
and growing trade deficit over most of the business cycle. The trade deficit replaced domestic demand,
preventing the economy from approaching normal levels of employment (even with the boost from the housing
bubble) until just before the crash.
There is no reason whatsoever to believe that China's decision to prop up the dollar was in any way affected by
the Bush tax cuts. In other words, neither the Bush tax cuts nor the growth in entitlements had anything to do
with our borrowing from China. The issue was China's decision to lend and thereby prop up the dollar. Given
the weakness of demand through most of the decade, these expenses could have been easily filled by domestic
production without borrowing from abroad.
Friedman does no better when he shifts the discussion from the past to the present. He refers to businesses'
reluctance to hire as the result of ""unusual uncertainty,"" a phrase attributed to Federal Reserve Board Chairman
Ben Bemanke. Of course there is no reluctance to hire, there is simply a lack of demand for labor. A reluctance
to hire would be reflected in an increasing number of hours per worker, as employers sought to meet their
demand for labor by working the existing workforce more hours.
This is not happening. There is a modest uptick in hours from the low point of the downturn, but the increase
in hours per worker is certainly no more rapid than in other recessions and the average workweek is still far
shorter in just about every sector than it was before the downturn.
Later he tells readers:
""America's solvency inflection point is coinciding with a technological one. Thanks to Internet diffusion, the
rise of cloud computing, social networking and the shift from laptops and desktops to hand-held iPads and
iF'hones, technology is destroying older, less skilled jobs that paid a decent wage at a faster pace than ever
while spinning off more new skilled jobs that pay a decent wage but require more education than ever.""
This is a great story -- social networking is soaring, IPads are everywhere -- does Friedman have any evidence
whatsoever that this development has increased the demand for educated workers and reduced the demand for
less educated workers? If so, this would be the place in his column to present the evidence. Otherwise, readers
might think that the 4.7 percent unemployment rate for college grads (nearly triple the pre-recession level),
coupled with a decline in their real wages over the decade, implies a reduced demand for the labor of highly
educated workers as well as less educated workers.
Friedman's proposed fix also seems a bit wide of the mark. He insists:
""There is only one way to deal with this challenge: more innovation to stimulate new industries and jobs that
can pay workers $40 an hour, coupled with a huge initiative to train more Americans to win these jobs over
their global competitors. There is no other way.""
We better hope there is another way. A wage of $40 an hour would put a worker well over the 90th percentile
on the wage distribution. Even if we double the number of jobs in this pay range -- an incredible
accomplishment -- what happens to the other 80 percent of the workforce?
Friedman then warns us of the challenge from Europe by getting Germany's past and present wrong:
""Keeping up with Germany won't be easy. A decade ago Germany was the 'sick man of Europe.' No more. The
Germans pulled together. Labor gave up wage hikes and allowed businesses to improve competitiveness and
worker flexibility, while the government subsidized firms to keep skilled workers on the job in the downturn.""
Germany clearly has done sorne changes that benefited its economy, like work sharing, and some that haven't,
but its past as the ""sick man of Europe"" is an invention of Friedman or his highly placed sources. Germany
always ran a trade surplus. That is the most basic measure of a country's competitiveness: foreigners are buying
its goods. Germany's unemployment rate in 2.000 ayeravd 7
.,5_percept, not hugely different than its current 7.0
percent rate.
The story here is that Friedman seems to have completely missed the basics of the current economic crisis in
spite of his weeks of conversing with senior economic policy makers. The current crisis is due to a lack of
demand pure and simple. If we generate demand either through more expansionary Fed monetary policy,
greater fiscal stimulus, or increased exports due to a falling dollar, there is no reason to believe that the
economy will not return to high levels of employment. Certainly Friedman has presented no evidence that
increased demand will not generate increased employment as it always has.
The longer term debt problem is overwhelmingly a health care story. Apparently Mr. Friedman's sources don't
have access to documents like the Medicare trustees report, which imply that U.S. health care costs will be
controlled and there will be no serious long-term deficit problem. This may prove -Wrong, but it seems that it
would have at least been worth noting in his column. Of course, if we have not fixed our health care system,
we can always achieve huge saving by retyinq on the more efficient health care systems in other countries.
If Friedman's intention was to scare us, he succeeded. After all, if senior economic policy makers in the U.S.
and Germany are as badly misinformed as Friedman implies, then we can expect some very had times ahead.","UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05771122 Date: 08/31/2015

simply do an op-ed. Sid
Does Thomas Friedman Have to Talk to ""Senior Economic Policy Makers"" to Get So
Many Things Wrong?
Dean Baker is co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington, DC.
Wednesday, 18 August 2010 04:04
Thomas Friedman begins his oiece 1Q(44v by telling readers that: ""over the past few weeks I've had a chance to
speak with senior economic policy makers in America and Germany."" This might lead readers to believe that
he is about to share some great insights that would only be possible for someone with special access to these
senior economic policy makers.
Readers with this expectation will be seriously disappointed. There is nothing here that is more insightful than
what can be found on the Washington Post's editorial pages on an average workday. Friedman rehashes the
usual cliches, with the usual lack of thought. In doing so, he gets both the story of the recent past and the
present seriously wrong.
Starting with the past, he badly misrepresents the prior business cycle:
""we've just ended more than a decade of debt-fueled growth during which we borrowed money from China to
give ourselves a tax cut and more entitlements but did nothing to curtail spending or make long-term
investments in new growth engines.""
The main problem facing the U.S. economy of the last decade was a lack of demand. This was in large part due
to the fact that China lent to us. China's lending was its policy of propping up the value of the dollar in order to
maintain its export market in the United States. (At the start of the decade, the Clinton administration had also
tried to promote an over-valued dollar.) The over-valued -U.S. dollar made imports from China and other
countries very cheap in the United States and made our exports expensive in other countries. This led to a large
and growing trade deficit over most of the business cycle. The trade deficit replaced domestic demand,
preventing the economy from approaching normal levels of employment (even with the boost from the housing
bubble) until just before the crash.
There is no reason whatsoever to believe that China's decision to prop up the dollar was in any way affected by
the Bush tax cuts. In other words, neither the Bush tax cuts nor the growth in entitlements had anything to do
with our borrowing from China. The issue was China's decision to lend and thereby prop up the dollar. Given
the weakness of demand through most of the decade, these expenses could have been easily filled by domestic
production without borrowing from abroad.
Friedman does no better when he shifts the discussion from the past to the present. He refers to businesses'
reluctance to hire as the result of ""unusual uncertainty,"" a phrase attributed to Federal Reserve Board Chairman
Ben Bemanke. Of course there is no reluctance to hire, there is simply a lack of demand for labor. A reluctance
to hire would be reflected in an increasing number of hours per worker, as employers sought to meet their
demand for labor by working the existing workforce more hours.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05771122 Date: 08/31/2015
This is not happening. There is a modest uptick in hours from the low point of the downturn, but the increase
in hours per worker is certainly no more rapid than in other recessions and the average workweek is still far
shorter in just about every sector than it was before the downturn.
Later he tells readers:
""America's solvency inflection point is coinciding with a technological one. Thanks to Internet diffusion, the
rise of cloud computing, social networking and the shift from laptops and desktops to hand-held iPads and
iF'hones, technology is destroying older, less skilled jobs that paid a decent wage at a faster pace than ever
while spinning off more new skilled jobs that pay a decent wage but require more education than ever.""
This is a great story -- social networking is soaring, IPads are everywhere -- does Friedman have any evidence
whatsoever that this development has increased the demand for educated workers and reduced the demand for
less educated workers? If so, this would be the place in his column to present the evidence. Otherwise, readers
might think that the 4.7 percent unemployment rate for college grads (nearly triple the pre-recession level),
coupled with a decline in their real wages over the decade, implies a reduced demand for the labor of highly
educated workers as well as less educated workers.
Friedman's proposed fix also seems a bit wide of the mark. He insists:
""There is only one way to deal with this challenge: more innovation to stimulate new industries and jobs that
can pay workers $40 an hour, coupled with a huge initiative to train more Americans to win these jobs over
their global competitors. There is no other way.""
We better hope there is another way. A wage of $40 an hour would put a worker well over the 90th percentile
on the wage distribution. Even if we double the number of jobs in this pay range -- an incredible
accomplishment -- what happens to the other 80 percent of the workforce?
Friedman then warns us of the challenge from Europe by getting Germany's past and present wrong:
""Keeping up with Germany won't be easy. A decade ago Germany was the 'sick man of Europe.' No more. The
Germans pulled together. Labor gave up wage hikes and allowed businesses to improve competitiveness and
worker flexibility, while the government subsidized firms to keep skilled workers on the job in the downturn.""
Germany clearly has done sorne changes that benefited its economy, like work sharing, and some that haven't,
but its past as the ""sick man of Europe"" is an invention of Friedman or his highly placed sources. Germany
always ran a trade surplus. That is the most basic measure of a country's competitiveness: foreigners are buying
its goods. Germany's unemployment rate in 2.000 ayeravd 7
.,5_percept, not hugely different than its current 7.0
percent rate.
The story here is that Friedman seems to have completely missed the basics of the current economic crisis in
spite of his weeks of conversing with senior economic policy makers. The current crisis is due to a lack of
demand pure and simple. If we generate demand either through more expansionary Fed monetary policy,
greater fiscal stimulus, or increased exports due to a falling dollar, there is no reason to believe that the
economy will not return to high levels of employment. Certainly Friedman has presented no evidence that
increased demand will not generate increased employment as it always has.

5619,C05770518,READOUT FROM AFGHAN WOMEN'S CONFERENCE OVER THE WEEKEND.,H,,2010-07-19T04:00:00+00:00,Readout from Afghan women's conference over the weekend.,,"Verveer, Melanne S <VerveerMS©state.gov>","The writer is someone who has worked with Afghan women in developing small businesses in Afghanistan and is doing a
book about the experience.
She went back to Afghanistan for the conference that women had over the weekend and wrote the article that follows
for today's Daily Beast.
Soraya mentioned here is one of our Women of Courage. Gayle (the writer) told me in a separate email that De Mistura
was very sympathetic and said they should be consulted, that the current documents are working documents and he
pledged that the women would be more inovled in the follow up. He also told them that he was very impressed that
they had organized themselves in this 2-day conference to be able to play a more effective role. Zakhilwal was gracious,
but said they were adequately consulted. So it goes.
Secretary Clinton may be one of the highest-profile attendees at Tuesday's Kabul Conference, but
Afghan women fear their opinions won't be heard—and they worry new deals with fighters will roll
back their hard-fought rights.
As Hillary Clinton prepares to attend Tuesday's Kabul Conference, Afghan women are delivering a plain message to
government and international officials: Women's voices should be heard.
""We have to be honest. With respect to the Kabul Conference, we have not been consulted,"" said Soraya Pakzad, founder
of a women's shelter in the western Afghan city of Herat. Her comment came during an unusually heated question-and-
answer session with Afghan Finance Minister Omar Zakhilwal and United Nations representative Staffan de
Mistura marking the end of a two-day women's conference. ""We want to be involved in policy-making. We don't want our
presence to be purely symbolic.""
""Women's rights and achievements should not be compromised in any peace negotiations or
accords.""
The Kabul Conference is, in part, built on symbolism. A follow-up to January's London Conference, the gathering marks
the first time Afghanistan has played host to its international donors, a decision that is intended to showcase the transition
from foreign to Afghan ownership of national priorities. More than 65 international delegations are expected to descend
upon the Afghan capital, which is already enduring security crackdowns and traffic gridlock. Workers could be seen
Sunday painting curbs and planting flowers in advance of the foreigners' arrival.
Discussions will center around five topics, including economic development, agriculture, governance, and security. The
goal of the half-day event is to establish a framework for Afghan leadership in the setting—and execution—of the
country's political and economic direction.
Although it remains to be seen how quickly the Afghan govemment, long under-resourced and beset by allegations of
corruption, will be able to take the reins from its international donors, there is no question that Afghan ownership is the
direction in which things are moving, on the political, economic, and security fronts. And that is precisely why women feel
the stakes for this week's meeting are so high, particularly in light of new deals to empower local militias that might
threaten women's rights.
""After the Kabul Conference, no one knows what else could be on the agenda apart from war escalations and
negotiations,"" said Orzala Ashraf, an Afghan human rights activist. ""This is very important for us, to get a serious and
honest commitment from our government in the presence of all witnesses from the world that our voices will not be
silenced.""
Ashraf and a number of other women's advocates view Tuesday's talks are their last, best shot at speaking out about their
concerns, with help from European and American officials who have been working hard to help them win a seat at the
table. In another show of support, Secretary Clinton and Danish Foreign Minister Lene Espersen will meet Tuesday
morning with a group of women leaders.
Regardless of this high-profile backing, many women say they have little faith in the process to produce anything aside
from more paper and more unkept promises.
""Women are very tired of all these conferences; the government is going to have to show commitments,"" said Selay
Ghaffar, an Afghan Women's Network board member. ""We want things to change.""
And it remains unclear how many Afghans outside Kabul, men or women, are paying attention to yet another gathering to
discuss their future.
""Women in the provinces don't even know about this,"" said Zainab, a young math teacher from Helmand province. ""I
would say 60 percent of women have no idea this is going on.""
Others say the presence of one or two women at the Kabul Conference isn't enough to make a difference. And they say
they fear the recent move from NATO to empower local militias to fight the Taliban, particularly in southern Afghanistan.
""This is very dangerous,"" said Shahida Hussain, a human rights advocate from Kandahar who worked as a community
organizer during the Taliban years. ""We had militias during the communist years and Afghanistan was destroyed. We fear
war again.""
Women leaders say that they want peace and are glad to welcome back former fighters, but only if they respect women's
constitutional guarantee to equal protections under the law.
""Women should be a constituent part of all bodies outlined in the Afghanistan Peace and Reintegration Plan,"" said the
women in a statement at the end of their meeting. ""Women's rights and achievements should not be compromised in any
peace negotiations or accords.""
In the meantime, women continue to fight for a voice as Tuesday approaches. After a weeklong flurry of conference calls,
embassy meetings, and lunchtime gatherings, two women aside from government ministers are now slated to speak.
And in a small victory for women, international officials agreed with Pakzad's assessment before pledging that women
would be more involved going forward.
""I agree, you were not consulted,"" said da Mistura, appearing to contradict the Afghan finance minister, who only a few
moments earlier had said that women's views had and would be included. ""As usual, we have been paying lip service to
you and we are all at fault for that.""
Gayle Tzemach Lemmon covered presidential politics as a producer at ABC News in Washington. Since 2005, she has
been reporting on women entrepreneurs starting small and medium-sized businesses in post-conflict economies such as
Afghanistan, Bosnia and Rwanda. She is currently working on a book scheduled for 2010 publication by HarperCollins
about a young Afghan entrepreneur whose business supported her family and community during the Taliban years.","UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770518 Date: 08/31/2015

I heard a wonderful story last night praising Hillary Clinton for her work on behalf of children.
Last night I met Don Graves, he runs the Independent Living Skills Program (ILSP) in Contra Costa
County. The program helps children in the foster care system, and among other things, teaches them
skills needed to live on their own as adults.
Don told a heart-warming story of how then First Lady Hillary Clinton came out to visit with the kids in the
program and hear their concerns. A major concern was that resources for kids coming out of foster care
ended at age 18 and 6 months -- they needed more help. Within two years of the visit, President Clinton
signed the Foster Care Independence Act, providing more money and more resources for ages 18 - 21. I
think it is widely accepted that Hillary championed this legislation, and this was surely echoed by Don. He
was beaming with admiration for her and what she accomplished to help the kids.
He went on to say that one of the participants in the program, Alfred Perez, who was part of the original
discussion with the First Lady, was invited to the White House to see the bill signed. Alfred Perez later
served on the Pew Commission on Foster care and is now teaching at the University of
Chicago. http://www.ssa.uchicaoo.edu/facultv/ptlect/Derez-a.shtml

Palestinians Say Talks With Israel Should Be Suspended
By ETHAN BRONNER
New York Times
RAMALLAH, West Bank — The Palestinian leadership said Saturday that four-week-old direct talks with Israel should be suspended as
long as Jewish settlement housing was being built in the West Bank. It called on the international community to pressure Israel to stop
the construction.
A statement issued after a meeting of about 35 Palestinian leaders — the executive committee of the Palestine Liberation Organization,
the central committee of the main Fatah movement and a handful of others — held at the compound of the Palestinian Authority
president, Mahmoud Abbas, said that Israel was responsible for the deadlock.
""The leadership confirms that the resumption of talks requires tangible steps, the first of them a freeze on settlements,""Yasser Abed
Rabb°, a senior P.L.O. official said after the three-hour meeting. ""The Palestinian leadership holds Israel responsible for obstructing the
negotiations.""
The Obama administration envoy to the region, George J. Mitchell, met repeatedly in recent days with Mr. Abbas and Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel in hopes of keeping the new talks alive. But he left on Friday, having made no progress.
Mr. Mitchell remains in the region, talking with Arab leaders before an Arab League meeting planned for next Friday in Libya, where
the issue of direct talks with Israel will be debated and where, Mr. Abbas has said, a final decision on the future of the talks will be
made.
Barring a last-minute deal, the talks seemed to be in deep trouble.
Mr. Abbas was due to see King Hussein of Jordan on Sunday and then Hosni Mubarak, the president of Egypt, as efforts continue to
find a solution.

Israel halted most settlement construction for 10 months last November, saying it viewed the politically difficult step as a gesture to lure
the Palestinians into direct peace talks. Mr. Abbas consented to the talks nine months later but threatened to abandon them if the freeze
was lifted.
Mr. Netanyahu argues that the future of the settlements should be part of a mix of issues to be discussed in the coming year of talks, not
a precondition for talks. The Palestinians say the Israelis agreed to end settlement expansion in a 2003 road map for peace and have
failed to live up to that commitment. They add that settlements violate international law and are eating up the land on which they plan
to build their state.
Mr. Netanyahu told his close aides on Friday that he would not freeze settlements further but would limit the building, according to an
official briefed on that meeting.
""Everyone knows that restrained and moderate building in Judea and Samaria in the coming year will not affect the peace map at all,""
he said, according to the official, using the biblical term for the West Bank. ""Therefore the international community must call on the
Palestinians to stay in the peace talks. It is in the interest of the Palestinians, just as it is in ours.""
Since Mr. Abed Rabbo on Saturday also asked for assistance from the international community, it now appears that both sides, instead
of talking to each other, have returned to making their cases to the world, hoping other governments will intercede on their behalf.
The Obama administration has offered Israel security guarantees and military hardware in exchange for a one-time 6o-day extension of
the building freeze. But so far Mr. Netanyahu has turned that down, saying that sticking to his word on a one-time freeze was more
important than the elements of the American offer.
The Palestinians say they, too, have concerns about credibility if they return to talks while settlement building resumes.
Nabil Abu Rudeineh, a close aide to Mr. Abbas, said Saturday that Mr. Abbas had staked his credibility on ending negotiations if
settlements began again. Asked how to assess the diplomacy of recent days, Mr. Abu Rudeineh said, ""So far efforts have reached a dead
end.""

As you know I have good links to the Qataris. Sheikha Mosah's son is the 31/32 year old Crown Prince and she is keen
that he starts to build a wider international profile. He has been appointed head of the Qatar National Food Security
Programme which is designed to deal with Qatar's food security issues its a $30 billion programme. He is aware that
food security is an issue you are majoring on and would love to meet with you in person to discuss this and to explore
potential partnership areas between US and Qatar including possible participation in the US/World Bank Food Security
Fund. He is also keen to talk more generally about US/Qatari cooperation and even suggested they could help out with
the Oil spill problem. There is apparently a Arab Food Security Summit in October 2010 and he would like to discuss Us
participation in that too.
IS a meeting possible he is more flexible on place and times than his mother! Or maybe we could set up an initial phone
call.
Can you let me know if this appeals to you at all?

BREAKING — DNC goes up on national cable Tuesday with an ad on ""The Boehner plan."" A
DNC official says it'll be up a little less than a week: 'This ad is one product we'll use to
define Mr. Boehner, his ethics and priorities for the American people - and there will be others.""

ROBERT GIBBS (*PressSec) tweets on the NYT front-pager on House Republican
Leader John Boehner: ""Headline says it all.. .A G.O.P. Leader Tightly Bound to Lobbyists
http://nyti.ms/bxbF4D ... Don't forget this handy clip & save graphic of 'I( Street Cabinet'
(black & white photo doesn't do that tan justice!) http://nyti.ms/9n1wVp""
BOEHNER taped ""Face the Nation"" yesterday from West Chester, Ohio:
Bob Schieffer: ""I want to make sure I heard what you said correctly: you're saying that you are
willing to vote for those middle class tax cuts, even though the bill will not include ... extending
the tax cuts for the upper bracket American.""
Rep. Boehner: ""Bob, we don't know what the bill's going to say, alright? If the only option I
have is to vote for those at 250 and below, of course I'm going to do that. But I'm going to do
everything I can to fight to make sure that we extend the current tax rates for all Americans.""
A Boehner aide reads between the lines: ""Despite what Obama says, Republicans are not
holding middle-class tax cuts hostage and we're not going to let him get away with those types of
false claims. Our focus remains on getting bipartisan support for a freeze on all current rates,
because that is what is best for the economy and small business job creation. Boehner's words
were calculated to deprive Obama of the ability to continue making those false claims, and as a
result we are in a better position rhetorically to pressure more Democrats to support a full
freeze.""
AN INSTANT CLASSIC:
Schieffer: ""Mr. Boehner, I'm going to ask you this question because I'm not objective about this
- I'm a cancer survivor, I used to be a heavy smoker. Do you still smoke?""
Boehner: ""I do.""
Schieffer: ""You have taken $340,000 from the tobacco industry. They've been the largest
contributor to your political campaigns over the year. How do you square that with the fact that
cigarette smoking is the leading cause of preventable deaths in this country, 435,000 people,
their deaths are linked to cancer, that's 1 in 5. How do you justify that in your own mind?""
Boehner:i""Bob, tobacco is a legal product in America. The American people have a right to
decide for themselves whether they want to partake or not. There are lots of things that we deal
with and come in contact with every day, from alcohol to food to cigarettes, a lot of the things
that aren't good for our health. But the American people ought to have the right to make those
decisions on their own."" ...
Schleifer: ""If you should become Speaker, you could set a good example for the country by
saying, 'I'm going to stop smoking.' Maybe you could get the President, I understand he smokes
too, maybe the two of you could find a way to try to stop smoking. That'd be kind of a good
thing, wouldn't it?""

Bob Schieffer: ""I want to make sure I heard what you said correctly: you're saying that you are
willing to vote for those middle class tax cuts, even though the bill will not include ... extending
the tax cuts for the upper bracket American.""
Rep. Boehner: ""Bob, we don't know what the bill's going to say, alright? If the only option I
have is to vote for those at 250 and below, of course I'm going to do that. But I'm going to do
everything I can to fight to make sure that we extend the current tax rates for all Americans.""
A Boehner aide reads between the lines: ""Despite what Obama says, Republicans are not
holding middle-class tax cuts hostage and we're not going to let him get away with those types of
false claims. Our focus remains on getting bipartisan support for a freeze on all current rates,
because that is what is best for the economy and small business job creation. Boehner's words
were calculated to deprive Obama of the ability to continue making those false claims, and as a
result we are in a better position rhetorically to pressure more Democrats to support a full
freeze.""

GAME CHANGE: 2012 OFF TO SLOW START – GOP heavyweights hold back, freezing field
compared to past cycles -- Jonathan Martin and Ben Smith: ""[T]he primary is on track to start later, and
more cautiously, than it has in the recent past. In the fall of 2006, Mitt Romney and John McCain were openly
battling over endorsements from Republican operatives, donors and even county sheriffs in the early primary
states. The two men beat a well-worn path to New Hampshire, South Carolina, and especially Iowa, where they
had to watch their step to avoid tripping over Democratic hopefuls like John Edwards and Evan Bayh. But at the
same point four years later, as the 2010 election enters the home stretch, top-tier Republican presidential
contenders are hesitant to set foot in the states that kick off the presidential campaign process, let alone issue
press releases touting their latest gets there.
--""[Thell GOP nominating contest is shaping up ... as a game of chicken ... Romney, Sarah Palin, Haley
Barbour, Mitch Daniels and a few other ambitious figures are largely eyeing each other while publicly holding
back, leaving Tim Pawlenty as the only mainstream Republican trudging down the traditional, early path ...
Together, they're all making a mockery of the conventional wisdom about the longer and longer arcs that
modern White House campaigns demand. ... There are three main reasons for the delay: The intense focus on
the 2010 midterms; the risks of starting too early; and, especially for the best-prepared candidate, Romney, a
paralyzing fear of failure in Iowa. In a sense, the incentives this year are reversed: candidates have better
reasons to publicly hold off on declaring their candidacy than to try to gain an early foothold.""

STORY DU JOUR – N.Y. Times Al, 1 col. at the fold, ""G.O.P. Leader Tightly Bound to Lobbyists,"" by
Eric Lipton: ""Mr. Boehner ... maintains especially tight ties with a circle of lobbyists and former aides
representing some of the nation's biggest businesses ... They have contributed hundreds of thousands of dollars
to his campaigns, provided him with rides on their corporate jets, socialized with him at luxury golf resorts and
waterfront bashes and are now leading fund-raising efforts for his Boehner for Speaker campaign, which is
soliciting checks of up to $37,800 each, the maximum allowed. Some of the lobbyists readily acknowledge
routinely seeking his office's help — calling the congressman and his aides as often as several times a week.""

--A BOEHNER AIDE: ""Boehner's positions on the issues he cited are longstanding, and are obviously not the

responded to Lipton, adding 'I can tell you why, if you care.' Steel says he received no further notes from

TOP STORY — NYT col. 1, ""Afghan Security Growing Worse, Aid Groups Say,"" by Rod Nordland, in
Kabul: ""Large parts of the country that were once completely safe, like most of the northern provinces, now
have a substantial Taliban presence ... The worsening security comes as the Obama administration is under
increasing pressure to show results to maintain public support for the war, and raises serious concerns about
whether the country can hold legitimate nationwide elections for Parliament next Saturday. Unarmed
government employees can no longer travel safely in 30 percent of the country's 368 districts, according to
published United Nations estimates ... The number of insurgent attacks has increased significantly ... American
military officials say the increased level of violence is related to the rise in the number of its forces here. The
last 2,000 of 30,000 new American troops are expected to arrive in the next week or two, military officials say.
The result is more military operations, they say, and more opportunities for the insurgents to attack coalition
forces."" http://nyti.ms/bImb8E
--DOYLE McMANUS, in L.A. Times ""Opinion"" section, ""High-level doubts on Afghanistan: Former
officials who once supported the war are now questioning it's worth the cost"": ""The doubters include
Richard N. Haass, president of the Council on Foreign Relations, the closest thing the United States has to an
official 'foreign policy establishment'; Leslie H. Gelb, his predecessor; and Robert D. Blackwill, a former aide
to President George W. Bush. 'The current strategy isn't working, and it's costing roughly $100 billion a year,'
Haass, a former aide to then-Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, told me last week. 'It's time for a major
recalibration: not an immediate withdrawal but a significant scaling down of our ambitions.' And last week, a
group of 46 foreign policy experts issued a joint report arguing that the goal of building a unified, stable
Afghanistan is beyond the ability of the United States, and unnecessary to boot. The panel, the Afghanistan
Study Group, included both longtime critics of the war and some who supported U.S. policy until recently. ...
They cite three main reasons for their escalating pessimism. The first: setbacks (including a major offensive in
Kandahar that was scheduled to be in full swing by now but is only getting underway). Next: Afghan President
Hamid Karzai's failure to support a U.S.-sponsored anti-corruption campaign. And finally, there's that $100-
billion annual price tag. ... [A]s Obama approaches a December review of his strategy in Afghanistan, the
debate is noticeably opening up, driven in part by the weight of that $100-billion cost."" http://lat.ms/9XfIcyC

TOP TALKERS:
MAUREEN DOWD, ""When Peggy Left Barry: Plus ca change, plus c'est la meme chose"": ""One of the
independent voters Obama will be trying to charm over the next two years is my sister, Peggy, a formerly ardent
Obamican (a Republican who changed spots to vote for Obama). ... Despite being a Washington native, Peggy
believed that the dazzling young newcomer could change Washington. But she has lost a lot of faith now,
saying she might vote for Mitt Romney over Obama if Romney is the Republican nominee in 2012. (Sarah
Palin shouldn't count on her vote though. In Peggy's words, 'Are you nuts?') Peggy thinks the president has
done fine managing W.'s messes in Iraq and Afghanistan. And she lights up at the mention of his vice president,
Joe Biden. But she thinks Obama has to get 'a backbone' if he wants to lure her back to the fold. ... While
Obama's out in the country trying to save Congressional Democrats, he should also think about how he's going
to save himself. http://nyti.ms/92Dudr
FRANK RICH, ""Time for This Big Dog to Bite Back: The Democrats' obituaries may yet prove
premature."": ""On Labor Day, the fighting Obama abruptly re-emerged, a far cry from the man whose Oval
Office address on Iraq days earlier was about as persuasive as a hostage video. ... For a guy facing a tidal wave,
the president was so ebullient, you had to wonder if he knew something we didn't. Maybe he simply read the
unabridged poll numbers ... Those numbers are hardly as monochromatic as advertised. Obama's approval
rating, for months a consistent (not imploding) 45-ish percent, still makes him arguably America's most popular
national politician. The polls also continue to show that, while both political parties are despised, Democrats are
slightly less despised than Republicans. ... In a second forceful speech last week, delivered outside Cleveland,
Obama titillated the political press by calling out Boehner by name eight times. But though Boehner is a nice
soft target ... he's merely a front-man. Obama must also call out the powerful interests who are pulling the
G.O.P.'s strings (and filling its coffers), whether on Wall Street or in Big Oil or any other sector where special
interests are aligned against reform in the public interest. If Obama can speak lucidly about a subject as thorny
as race, he can surely do a far more specific job of telling the story of how we got to this economic impasse.""

MEDIA WATCH – ""Bret Baier is the new face of Election Night coverage at Fox News: 40-year-old
reporter part of a new generation of political news anchors,"" by Baltimore Sun's David Zurawik: ""Baier
steps up this fall as lead political news anchor on Election Night replacing Brit Hume, who moved after the
2008 elections to the role of senior political analyst. Given the way Fox News has come to lead in ratings for
coverage of political events since CNN's glory days during the presidential campaign of 2008, Baier's ascension
makes for a significant changing of the guard in broadcast journalism. The seat he now occupies in Fox's
Washington studios is one of the most influential in American political life — a fact not lost on the boyish-
looking anchorman who turned 40 on Aug. 4, which also is President Barack Obama's birthday. ... He has been
invited for the first time in his career to moderate a televised debate — a role more often reserved for the likes
of Jim Lehrer or Bob Schieffer of public and network TV. This one will be held Oct. 4 in Hartford, Conn., in a
hotly contested race between Democrat Richard Blumenthal and Republican Linda McMahon for a U.S. Senate
seat. ...
""As for his hour of news from 6 p.m. to 7 p.m. weeknights ['Special Report], Baier almost doubles the
combined audience of his competitors on CNN and MSNBC. So far this year, 'Special Report' has an
average nightly audience of 2,107,000 in viewers — compared with 604,000 for 'The Ed Show' on MSNBC
and 545,000 for Wolf Blitzer's 'Situation Room' on CNN. ... Michael Clemente, senior vice president at Fox
News, says the foundation laid down by Hume has played a crucial role in Baler's success. 'Brit Hume had the
legacy with the audience — a legacy that went back to his days with ABC News,' Clemente says. `So why has
it worked with Bret? First of all, the transition was handled well; Bret filled in quite a bit as Brit was winding
down. But people make a judgment pretty quickly, and I think they judged Bret as being an honest, fair and
smart reporter. And it wasn't like pulling some guy out of thin air who had just been a news reader on some
local station.' ... [Baier:] 'You know the Fox Atlanta bureau that I joined in 1998 — that started in my
apartment in Atlanta with a fax machine and a cell phone. That was the bureau. And I still have that sense of us
being that startup that is still trying to make it all come together."" http://bit.ly/apgxA2

expected victory over the Cavaliers, a near three-touchdown underdog playing their first game in California.

Gordon was convinced he had to sacrifice himself for any attempt to form a grand progressive coalition with the Lib-Dems.
Clegg had said during the campaign he would not deal with Gordon and he remained adamant. Peter, Alastair, Ed Balls,
and Ed Miliband met secretly with the LD team on Sunday. Gordon decided to fall on his sword today. The negotiations
between Labour and the LDs now are engaged with the same teams. The Tories at the same time also are negotiating.
Both offer competing plans for electoral reform that would give the LDs more representation in the future. If the LDs strike
a deal with the Tories Labour is unlikely to support it and campaign against that referendum. Cameron is strained right
now. His right does not approve of a deal while others push him to make an arrangement in order to attain power.
Cameron may be limited in how far he can go in his offer. But by no means is a Labour-LD deal certain or even probable,
even given Gordon's political suicide. The campaign for leader to replace Gordon begins as soon as the Labour-LD
negotiations are concluded. David is ready to go; he will face Ed Balls and possibly his brother Ed. If there is a coalition
that would tilt against Balls, who is seen as Gordon's heir and as an inappropriate PM, Gordon redux, to work with the
LDs. One of the Milibands will emerge. I still bet on David. So four days after the election, everything is still in play. Sid","UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770294 Date: 08/31/2015

Clegg had said during the campaign he would not deal with Gordon and he remained adamant. Peter, Alastair, Ed Balls,
and Ed Miliband met secretly with the LD team on Sunday. Gordon decided to fall on his sword today. The negotiations
between Labour and the LDs now are engaged with the same teams. The Tories at the same time also are negotiating.
Both offer competing plans for electoral reform that would give the LDs more representation in the future. If the LDs strike
a deal with the Tories Labour is unlikely to support it and campaign against that referendum. Cameron is strained right
now. His right does not approve of a deal while others push him to make an arrangement in order to attain power.
Cameron may be limited in how far he can go in his offer. But by no means is a Labour-LD deal certain or even probable,
even given Gordon's political suicide. The campaign for leader to replace Gordon begins as soon as the Labour-LD
negotiations are concluded. David is ready to go; he will face Ed Balls and possibly his brother Ed. If there is a coalition
that would tilt against Balls, who is seen as Gordon's heir and as an inappropriate PM, Gordon redux, to work with the
LDs. One of the Milibands will emerge. I still bet on David. So four days after the election, everything is still in play. Sid

ExxonMobil's senior management had just informed Kosmos/Blackstone that they were exercising a clause in the

Dear Mr. President,
We are writing to express our support for ratification of the New START Treaty and full funding
for the modernization of our nuclear weapons arsenal, as outlined by your updated report that
was mandated by Section 1251 of the Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010.
We also ask that, in your future budget requests to Congress, you include the funding identified
in that report on nuclear weapons modernization. Should you choose to limit non-defense
discretionary spending in any future budget requests to Congress, funding for nuclear
modernization in the National Nuclear Security Agency's proposed budgets should be
considered defense spending, as it is critical to national security and, therefore, not subject to
such limitations. Further, we ask that an updated 1251 report be submitted with your budget
request to Congress each year.
We look forward to working with you on the ratification of the New START Treaty and
modernization of the National Nuclear Security Agency's nuclear weapons facilities. This
represents a long-term commitment by each of us, as modernization of our nuclear arsenal will
require a sustained effort.
Sincerely,
Thad Cochran

CYRUS
NOW PLAYING
As diplomats stitch together a cease-fire between Hamas and Israel, the most depressing feature of
the conflict is the sense that future fighting is inevitable. Rational calculation suggests that neither
side can win these wars. The thousands of lives and billions of dollars sacrificed in fighting
demonstrate the advantages of peace and coexistence, yet still both sides opt to fight.
This small territory is the world's great symbolic knot. ""Palestine is the mother of all problems"" is a
common refrain among people we have interviewed across the Muslim world: from Middle
Eastern leaders to fighters in the remote island jungles of Indonesia; from Islamist senators in
Pakistan to volunteers for martyrdom on the move from Morocco to Iraq.
Some analysts see this as a testament to the essentially religious nature of the conflict. But research
we recently undertook suggests a way to go beyond that. For there is a moral logic to seemingly
intractable religious and cultural disputes. These conflicts cannot be reduced to secular
calculations of interest but must be dealt with on their own terms, a logic very different from the
marketplace or realpolitik.
Across the world, people believe that devotion to sacred or core values that incorporate moral
beliefs - like the welfare of family and country, or commitment to religion and honor - are, or
ought to be, absolute and inviolable. Our studies, carried out with the support of the National
Science Foundation and the Defense Department, suggest that people will reject material
compensation for dropping their commitment to sacred values and will defend those values
regardless of the costs.
In our research, we surveyed nearly 4,000 Palestinians and Israelis from 2004 to 2008,
questioning citizens across the political spectrum including refugees, supporters of Hamas and
Israeli settlers in the West Bank. We asked them to react to hypothetical but realistic compromises
in which their side would be required to give away something it valued in return for a lasting
peace.
All those surveyed responded to the same set of deals. First they would be given a straight-up offer
in which each side would make difficult concessions in exchange for peace, next they were given a
scenario in which their side was granted an additional material incentive, and last came a proposal
in which the other side agreed to a symbolic sacrifice of one of its sacred values.
For example, a typical set of trade-offs offered to a Palestinian might begin with this premise:
Suppose the UN organized a peace treaty between Israel and the Palestinians under which

Palestinians would be required to give up their right to return to their homes in Israel and there
would be two states, a Jewish state of Israel and a Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza.
Second, we would sweeten the pot: In return, Western nations would give the Palestinian state $10
billion a year for loo years. Then the symbolic concession: For its part, Israel would officially
apologize for the displacement of civilians in the 1948 war.
Almost everyone we surveyed rejected the initial solutions we offered - ideas that are accepted as
common sense among most Westerners, like simply trading land for peace or accepting shared
sovereignty over Jerusalem. Why the opposition?
Many of the respondents insisted that the values involved were sacred to them. For example,
nearly half the Israeli settlers we surveyed said they would not consider trading any land in the
West Bank - territory they believe was granted them by God - in exchange for peace. More than
half the Palestinians considered full sovereignty over Jerusalem in the same light, and more than
four-fifths felt that the ""right of return"" was a sacred value, too.
In general the greater the monetary incentive involved in the deal, the greater the disgust from
respondents. This strongly implies that using the standard approaches of ""businesslike
negotiations"" favored by Western diplomats will only backfire.
Many Westerners seem to ignore these clearly expressed ""irrational"" preferences, because in a
sensible world they ought not to exist. Diplomats hope that peace and progress on material and
quality-of-life matters will eventually make people forget the more heartfelt issues. But this is only
a recipe for another Hundred Years' War - progress on everyday material matters will simply
heighten attention on value-laden issues of ""who we are and want to be.""
Fortunately, our work also offers hints of another, more optimistic course.
Absolutists who violently rejected offers of money or peace for sacred land were considerably
more inclined to accept deals that involved their enemies making symbolic but difficult gestures.
For example, Palestinian hard-liners were more willing to consider recognizing the right of Israel
to exist if the Israelis simply offered an official apology for Palestinian suffering in the 1948 war.
Similarly, Israeli respondents said they could live with a partition of Jerusalem and borders very
close to those that existed before the 1967 war if Hamas and the other major Palestinian groups
explicitly recognized Israel's right to exist.
Remarkably, our survey results were mirrored by our discussions with political leaders from both
sides. For example, Mousa Abu Marzook (the deputy chairman of Hamas) said no when we
proposed a trade-off for peace without granting a right of return. He became angry when we added
in the idea of substantial American aid for rebuilding: ""No, we do not sell ourselves for any
amount.""

But when we mentioned a potential Israeli apology for 1948, he brightened: ""Yes, an apology is
important, as a beginning. It's not enough, because our houses and land were taken away from us,
and something has to be done about that."" This suggested that progress on values might open the
way for negotiations on material issues.
We got a similar reaction from Benjamin Netanyahu, the hard-line former Israeli prime minister.
We asked him whether he would seriously consider accepting a two-state solution following the
1967 borders if all major Palestinian factions, including Hamas, were to recognize the right of the
Jewish people to an independent state. He answered, ""O.K., but the Palestinians would have to
show that they sincerely mean it, change their textbooks and anti-Semitic characterizations.""
Making these sorts of wholly intangible ""symbolic"" concessions, like an apology or recognition of a
right to exist, simply doesn't compute on any utilitarian calculus. And yet the science says they may
be the best way to start cutting the knot.

With settlement deal, U.S. will be rewarding Israel's bad
behavior
By Daniel Kurtzer
Sunday, November 21, 2010;
It was only a little over a year and a half ago that the °barna administration demanded a freeze
on Israeli settlements in the occupied territories, including even the ""natural growth"" of existing
settlements. At the time, the administration called settlement activity ""illegitimate"" and appeared
ready to go to the mat with Israel to show just how strongly the United States believed that
settlements impede peace.
But now, the administration says it is prepared to pay off Israel to freeze only some of its
settlement activity, and only temporarily. For the first time in memory, the United States is
poised to reward Israel for its bad behavior.
Here's the offer that Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton is reported to have put on the
table recently: The United States will provide a package of advanced weaponry and military
assistance to Israel totaling several billion dollars, all in return for an Israeli commitment to
freeze settlement construction for just three months, excluding construction in Jerusalem. During
this period, the United States hopes Israel and the Palestinian Authority will negotiate an
agreement on the final borders of a future Palestinian state. The Israeli cabinet is weighing the
offer, having demanded a letter from Washington confirming the terms.
This is a very bad idea. And while Washington will almost certainly come to regret bribing
Israel, Israel may regret receiving such a bribe even more.
Previously, U.S. opposition to settlements resulted in penalties, not rewards, for continued
construction. Washington deducted from its loan guarantees to Israel an amount equivalent,
dollar for dollar, to the money that Israel spent in the occupied territories. While it's true that the
United States has turned a blind eye to indirect U.S. subsidies for Israeli activities in the
territories - such as tax deductions for American organizations that fund settlements - the deal
now being offered to Israel is of a totally different magnitude. If it goes forward, it will be the
first direct benefit that the United States has provided Israel for settlement activities that we have
opposed for more than 40 years.
It is not clear that Washington has thought through the implications. Will the United States
similarly reward Palestinians for stopping their own bad behavior? Will Washington pay them to,
say, halt the incitement against Israel and Jews in their public media and some educational
materials - something that shouldn't have been going on in the first place?

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05771514 Date: 08/31/2015
Will the rewards for Israel be automatically renewable? Meaning, if Israel is willing to continue
the settlement freeze after three months, will another set of rewards be the price for that?
And what about enforcement? Will the United States demand its money back if it learns about
construction during the freeze, even if that construction was not authorized by the Israeli
government?
The list of problems is so long that it would not be surprising if the administration were already
experiencing buyer's remorse. But the arrangement has an even more serious long-term
implication, one that should.worry Israel profoundly.
If it goes through, this deal will shake the foundation of the U.S.-Israeli strategic partnership.
Since the early 1980s, the two countries have cooperated closely on assessing Israeli security,
and Washington has promised to ensure Israel's ""qualitative military edge"" over any combination
of potential Arab adversaries.
This commitment has been insulated from the vicissitudes of politics and diplomacy. Whatever
the state of U.S.-Israeli relations or the peace process, America's commitment to Israel's security
has been manifest. Not so, if this deal materializes. By subjecting Israel's defense needs to the
political demands of an American administration, Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu has done
something quite dangerous for Israel - he has made those needs contingent, negotiable, optional.
Israel's security requirements are now merely a bargaining chip with which to negotiate what
Jerusalem will or will not do to advance the peace process.
Today, the United States has ""purchased"" a short-term settlements freeze; what will be for sale
tomorrow? For that matter, how seriously should our defense planners and congressional budget
watchers take Israel's arguments about its security needs when it is prepared to market different
elements of its policy for another squadron of advanced aircraft? Does anyone really believe that
there is a substantive connection between a three-month settlement freeze and Israel's professed
need for more airplanes?
These short-sighted tactics will lead both the United States and Israel into a long-term bind.
Washington will be left fending off a landslide of demands from others who hope to be rewarded
for their bad behavior, to be paid for stopping what they should never have been doing. Israel,
meanwhile, will be left struggling to explain how precious its settlements really are if a payoff -
albeit a high one - is enough to see them frozen.
And both countries will need a new rationale for the exceedingly steep price of what Israel calls
its security requirements, but which will now look more like poker chips used to secure
American aid.
This bargaining exercise has been unseemly all along. If it proceeds, both sides will probably
regret it. But the deal has not yet been sealed. And it is not too late to start over.

Appeals court reverses itself over Armenian suit
By PAUL ELIAS
The Associated Press
Friday, December 10, 2010; 6:12 PM
SAN FRANCISCO -- A federal appeals court on Friday reversed itself and now says the heirs of
Armenians killed in the Turkish Ottoman Empire can seek payment from companies that sold
their relatives life insurance.
The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco said a California law labeling the
killings as a ""genocide"" does not conflict with U.S. foreign policy, which the court said is
unsettled on the issue.
The ruling was 2-1, the same vote the same judicial panel came to last year when it struck down
the California law empowering the heirs to sue companies that sold life insurance policies to
Armenians killed in Ottoman-era Turkey during World War I.
Last year, the same panel concluded that the U.S. government has sided with the Turkish
goverment and formally taken the position against labeling the killings as a genocide.
Therefore, that panel concluded, California's calling the event a genocide conflicted with U.S.
foreign policy, making the state law invalid.
But in a rare and stunning move on Friday, Judge Dorothy Nelson changed her mind and sided
with Judge Harry Pregerson, which turned his 2009 dissenting view into law.
""We conclude that there is no express federal policy forbidding states to use the term 'Armenian
Genocide,"" Pregerson wrote.
The ruling revived a lawsuit filed by heirs against three German insurers, including Munich Re
AG.

""This was totally unexpected,"" said attorney Brian Kabateck, who represents the Armenian
heirs. ""It's a great victory for the Armenia people.""
Kabateck and other lawyers have filed similar lawsuits against New York Life Insurance Co.
and French insurer AXA, which were settled in 2005 for a combined $37.5 million.
Turkey has long denied that the loss of 1.5 million Armenian lives between 1915 and 1919
constituted genocide and instead describes the deaths as resulting from civil unrest that
accompanied the collapse of the Ottoman Empire.
Judge David Thompson, who wrote the now-overturned majority opinion last year, said in
dissent that former presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush defeated congressional
legislation that would have recognized an Armenian genocide. Thompson said those
presidential efforts show the United States has a clear foreign policy against recognizing the
deaths as a genocide.
The majority opinion Friday called those efforts ""informal presidential communications"" and
not official policy. The court said the insurance companies can file a request for a rehearing.
The companies could also ask the U.S. Supreme Court to consider the case.
Attorney Neil Michael Soltman, who represented the German insurance companies, said an
appeal decision hasn't been made.
Soltman said he was surprised by the decision since no new facts or legal cases were presented
to the appellate panel between its first decision in August 2009 and the court's about face
Friday.
""It's very rare that a panel changes its mind,"" Soltman said. ""Everything is exactly as it was in
August 2009, and all of sudden there's a new opinion. It's hard to explain.""

Europe's New Politics of Fear
by Denis MacShaneApril 16, 2010
There is a new divide in Europe. Not an iron curtain, but an iron intolerance as politicians revert to blaming minorities for
their nations' woes. In Western Europe it is Muslims. In Eastern Europe they are Jews, Roma, and gays. In the
Netherlands, Geert Wilders surged to an election victory in March on the back of anti-Muslim, anti-Quran populism. In
Hungary the Fidesz Party won big in recent elections with attacks on ""Jewish capital... which wants to devour the entire
world."" To the right of Fidesz is the openly anti-Jewish Jobbik Party, which won just two seats fewer than the Socialists. Its
leaders want to wear the neo-Nazi uniform of the pre-1939 Hungarian Guard when they take their seats in Budapest's
Parliament.
Contemporary political scientists do not like to highlight anti-Semitism. They prefer the term ""radical populism,"" but to
anyone with half a sense of European history, the parallels with an older, Jew-baiting politics can no longer be dismissed.
Economic dislocation and a rapid loss of confidence in traditional politics gave rise to ultranationalist movements in the
first half of the last century. Now a global recession and the hunt for someone to blame as jobs and incomes disappear is
producing the same toxic politics.
The Fidesz leader, Viktor Orban, was a youthful evangelist for liberalized open markets after 1990. Now he strikes a much
more nationalist tone. His Socialist opponents had to accept an austerity IMF package. Unlike Greece—which is being
helped, so far, by its euro-zone partners—Hungary was alone as boom-time euro loans to buy houses and cars had to be
paid back in an ever-devaluing forint. Blaming the Socialist government, globalization, and international capital was easy.
But Fidesz went further. In a bid for votes on the far right, a Fidesz parliamentarian, Oszkar Molnar, says it's time to give
""primacy to Hungarian interests over those of global capital, Jewish capital.""
Like Jean-Marie Le Pen's National Front in France, Jobbik has the support of about 15 percent of Hungarian voters. The
Czech right-wing ODS Party has had to dismiss its leader, former premier Mirek Topolanek, after he attacked the Jewish
origins of the current Czech prime minister and castigated the gay transport minister. In a new book, The Populist Radical
Right in Poland, the Oxford-educated Warsaw political professor Rafal Pankowski writes: ""Antisemitism is crucial to the
Polish populist right. The number of Jews in Poland today is minimal, but the anti-Jewish prejudice serves as a code for a
general hostility to diversity and to Polish [liberal] democracy."" For the time being, criticism of nationalist politics is
suspended as Poles mourn President Lech Kaczynski and other national leaders killed in the air-crash tragedy this month.
But the record of his party activists—including Michal Kaminski, Poland's best-known M.E.P. and leader of a small right-
wing group in the Strasbourg Parliament—is disturbing. An admirer of the late Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet,
Kaminski uses ugly language about gays, and says he will apologize for the killing of Jews on Polish soil in World War II
when ""Jews apologize for killing Poles.""
Mainstream political parties have sought to play down the rise of minority bashing. But Fidesz is affiliated with the center-
right European People's Party, which groups Angela Merkel's ruling Christian Democratic Union Party in Germany,
Nicolas Sarkozy's Union for a Popular Movement government in France, and ruling conservative parties in Sweden, Italy,
and Belgium. When Austrian rightist Jorg Haider entered a coalition in Austria a decade ago, the European Union held
Vienna in a political quarantine until Haider was removed. But Fidesz has a massive majority built on attacking ""Jewish
capital"" in language even Haider didn't dare utter.
So radical populism—anti-Muslim in Western Europe, anti-Jewish in Eastern Europe, and anti-foreigner and anti-
immigrant rhetoric everywhere—is no longer fringe politics. In Britain's general election, all the main parties are seeking to
appease anti-foreigner feeling with language on immigrants that they would not tolerate if applied to British citizens living
and working abroad. Comparisons with prewar Europe should not be overdrawn. Fascism is dead and not coming back.
But a new politics of intolerance is afoot in Europe, and no one knows how to deal with it.

What a Tea Party Looks Like in Europe
Marine Le Pen is moving her father's rabble-rousing, far-right
party away from the fringe, and redefining French politics in
the process.
by Tracy McNicoll and Christopher DickeySeptember 05, 2010
amuel Bollendorff / The New York Times-Redux
Marine Le Pen is the heir apparent to the leadership of the National Front, the right-wing party her father Jean-Marie (left)
leads today
Jean-Marie Le Pen, the 82-year-old firebrand of France's far right—the man who for decades has played on the inchoate
fears, xenophobia, knee-jerk racism, and ill-disguised anti-Semitism of many of his supporters—had just finished speaking
to the faithful on a farm not far from the English Channel. As members of the youth wing of his National Front party
feasted on barbecue and apple pie, they were thrilled to see the grand old man hold forth, still the ""provocateur"" taunting
the establishment, the ""toreador"" who hides the sword in his cape and lets the press run at him like a bull. Even these
youngsters knew, however, that Jean-Marie's time in the ring is nearing an end. The old man himself made it clear he's.
determined to step down. All eyes this day were on his daughter Marine. ""She has the will, the courage, the temperament
necessary, and the competence,"" Le Pen told reporters at the farmhouse. ""It seems to me indisputable that she is our
camp's best candidate for 2012.""
Tall, blonde, plain-spoken, and thick-skinned, Le Pen's youngest child, at 42, is the heir apparent to his party. She's
expected to win the contest for its leadership in January, and she's a passionate advocate of its core message: strong
French nationalism, relentless Euro-skepticism, and a lot of hard-nosed talk about fighting crime and immigration. She's a
fresh face, a new look, and, with rising poll numbers placing her third in a crowded field of possible 2012 candidates, a
new threat in French politics. In the eyes of many, she's more effective—and thus more dangerous—than her father.
It's a measure of the Le Pens' enhanced power that they've managed to push President Nicolas Sarkozy to the right and
cast their own party as mainstream. Over the summer, Sarkozy essentially gave up his flirtation with the left, which began
after his election in 2007. He had cherry-picked popular Socialists for his centrist government, dividing their party. But in
elections this past March, Sarkozy's UMP party managed to keep control of only one out of 22 regional governments. So
he decided to swing back to the right by playing on fears about public safety and immigration. He proposed taking
citizenship away from some criminals of immigrant background and launched a campaign against Roma (or ""Gypsies""),
booting hundreds out of the country. While the measures proved popular in opinion polls, Sarkozy, ironically, did not. His
abysmal approval ratings remain in the low 30s.
The younger Le Pen takes great pleasure in watching Sarkozy squirm. ""I think I get on [his] nerves quite a bit,"" she says.
""My profile is much more complicated for him to deal with than that of my father."" The old man could be painted as a
creature of the past, a purveyor of old prejudices with a ""sulfurous"" reputation, says Marine. Today, however, the Front
wants to bill itself as ""neither left nor right."" If that means losing some fringe elements (many of whom support Marine's
rival, Bruno Gollnisch), well, ""tent pis,"" she says.
Other right-wing movements in Europe are also pushing into the political mainstream. The government of Prime Minister
Silvio Berlusconi in Italy has long relied on its alliance with two groups that used to be considered extreme—one of them
the former Fascist Party under Gianfranco Fini, the other the secessionist Northern League of Umberto Bossi. A falling-out
between Berlusconi and Fini has left Bossi as the current kingmaker in Italian politics. In the Netherlands, the militantly
Islamophobic Geert Wilders won enough seats in the last elections to become a pivotal figure in the drawn-out process of
trying to build a new coalition government.
Yet these movements often differ in significant ways from the right wing that's made in the U.S.A. Put aside the usual
caricature of ""people in pointy hoods and the Ku Klux Klan,"" Marine Le Pen says, and she still believes ""the American right
is much more to the right than the National Front."" She might agree with those who want to manage American frontiers
more effectively and prevent massive illegal immigration, but she's also a big believer in the state's ability and obligation
to help its people. ""We feel the state should have the means to intervene,"" she says. ""We are very attached to public
services A la frangaise as a way to limit the inequalities among regions and among the French,"" including ""access for all to
the same level of health care.""
Le Pen grew up in a household that was all politics all the time, with her father the object of sometimes violent attacks by
competing factions on the right, as well as by the left. When Marine was just 8, someone set off a 20-kilo bomb in the
family's Paris apartment building. Miraculously, no one was killed or seriously injured, but the front of the building was
brought down. The crime has never been solved. ""The worst part wasn't just the attack, it was that not a single politician
sent a word of condolence,"" she says. ""It was difficult, but it builds character, it hardens you.""
That's a real asset in political life anywhere. If Sarkozy finds himself facing off against Marine Le Pen in the presidential
race a year and a half from now, he may find himself wishing her old man had stayed around a little longer.

6568,C05772553,S/P STAFF MEMBER'S ARTICLE ON MARIO VARGAS LLOSA,H,,2010-10-08T04:00:00+00:00,S/P staff member's article on Mario Vargas Llosa,,"Slaughter, Anne-Marie <SlaughterA@state.gov>","I thought that you might enjoy this by our newest S/P member, who was a journalist for the Wall Street Journalist and
other places before she joined us in September. She is on an International Affairs Fellowship from the Council on Foreign
Relations. They asked her to write the following; it was cleared by L. It is quite profound.
By EMILY PARKER
In 2007 I flew down to Lima to interview Mario Vargas Llosa for this newspaper. We talked in his elegant home,
surrounded by thousands of books. Mr. Vargas Llosa offered me a glass of red wine. Then he proceeded to
discuss why he believes that literature can change the world.
Mr. Vargas Llosa's Nobel Prize is a great victory—and not just for a talented and prolific author. His work is
perhaps the greatest rebuttal to those who believe that literature exists on the periphery of history and politics,
or who claim that they have ""no time"" for fiction.
In a New Republic essay in 2001, Mr. Vargas Llosa argued for granting literature ""an important place in the life
of nations."" He wrote, 'Without it, the critical mind, which is the real engine of historical change and the best
protector of liberty, would suffer an irreparable loss.""
Mr. Vargas Llosa's novels reflect his deep, personal hatred of dictatorships and his staunch belief in the value
of individual liberty. He is hardly the only novelist to have shed light on these themes, but I would argue that he
is among the most successful.
Columnist Mary Anastasia O'Grady on the anti-Communist Peruvian writer.
A case in point is ""Conversation in the Cathedral,"" the work that Mr. Vargas Llosa has said he would rescue
first from a fire. The novel is set in Peru, in the dark days of the Manuel Odria dictatorship of the 1950s, which
is when Mr. Vargas Llosa grew up. He told me that this was the book in which he wanted to describe how
dictatorships impregnate ""every act of life.""
To demonstrate this, Mr. Vargas Llosa paints around Odria rather than confronting him outright. The book
opens with a grim landscape of ""uneven and faded buildings"" and describes ""dull and defeated eyes at the
tables of Zela bar, hands that reach for ashtrays and glasses of beer."" The narrative, which rapidly jumps from

Subject: S/P staff member's article on Mario Vargas Llosa
I thought that you might enjoy this by our newest S/P member, who was a journalist for the Wall Street Journalist and
other places before she joined us in September. She is on an International Affairs Fellowship from the Council on Foreign
Relations. They asked her to write the following; it was cleared by L. It is quite profound.
By EMILY PARKER
In 2007 I flew down to Lima to interview Mario Vargas Llosa for this newspaper. We talked in his elegant home,
surrounded by thousands of books. Mr. Vargas Llosa offered me a glass of red wine. Then he proceeded to
discuss why he believes that literature can change the world.
Mr. Vargas Llosa's Nobel Prize is a great victory—and not just for a talented and prolific author. His work is
perhaps the greatest rebuttal to those who believe that literature exists on the periphery of history and politics,
or who claim that they have ""no time"" for fiction.
In a New Republic essay in 2001, Mr. Vargas Llosa argued for granting literature ""an important place in the life
of nations."" He wrote, 'Without it, the critical mind, which is the real engine of historical change and the best
protector of liberty, would suffer an irreparable loss.""
Mr. Vargas Llosa's novels reflect his deep, personal hatred of dictatorships and his staunch belief in the value
of individual liberty. He is hardly the only novelist to have shed light on these themes, but I would argue that he
is among the most successful.
Columnist Mary Anastasia O'Grady on the anti-Communist Peruvian writer.
A case in point is ""Conversation in the Cathedral,"" the work that Mr. Vargas Llosa has said he would rescue
first from a fire. The novel is set in Peru, in the dark days of the Manuel Odria dictatorship of the 1950s, which
is when Mr. Vargas Llosa grew up. He told me that this was the book in which he wanted to describe how
dictatorships impregnate ""every act of life.""
To demonstrate this, Mr. Vargas Llosa paints around Odria rather than confronting him outright. The book
opens with a grim landscape of ""uneven and faded buildings"" and describes ""dull and defeated eyes at the
tables of Zela bar, hands that reach for ashtrays and glasses of beer."" The narrative, which rapidly jumps from
past to present, describes a stalled, confused world. You don't know who to trust.

Subject: Karzai meeting
Dear Melanne and Saba,
I've attached the notes from our meeting with Karzai; they may be helpful in preparing for next week
On the positive side, he committed to including women in any formal negotiations with the Taliban. Hopefully we can nail that down
firmly -- it would be both a good safeguard and a signal to the Taliban of the kind of Afghanistan they will be joining if they do indeed
ever want to join it
Beyond that, he was in ""women's lives first, women's rights second"" mode — speaking passionately about the human cost of the
conflict and the impossibility of Afghanistan enjoying genuine human rights until the fighting ends. He did this to the point of
denying that any real human rights progress had come in his presidency (thus implying that bringing in Taliban would not make
matters worse).
In terms of your messaging, it would be great if, when the Secretary stresses that reconciling insurgents should accept the Afghan
constitution and laws, she specifically mentions the right of girls to go to school and work and take part in the political process. That
would be consistent, I think, with what the administration has said before, but more explicit. Karzai told us that his government
already stresses those specific rights (that's not true --but it suggests that it would be hard for them to disagree if the US and
international community made it part of their mantra).
It would also, of course, be great if she could find a way to express concern about giving reconciling Taliban leaders who have a track
record of brutality, including attacks on girls schools and killings of women who defy their threats, positions in local or national
government. One can support negotiations even with the worst of the worst of the Taliban, and offer them other kinds of
incentives. But we should draw the line at offering positions of authority over the lives of the people they have been terrorizing (as
the Pakistanis did, disastrously, in Swat).
Hope this helps,
Tom

Kurt and Cheryl,
In my meeting yesterday with FM Smith, he said he'd still like to speak with S. Originally, they were scheduled
to talk last Friday but it was cancelled. Given the change in leadership, and Smith's increased responsibility --
taking on trade and aid portfolios as well as foreign affairs -- I think a brief call would be helpful.
Also, I spoke at length with former PM Rudd on Monday. Although he did not raise the issue, his aide called
Edgard afterward and noted that Rudd had not heard from S, and would have hoped for a sympathetic call. I
have no strong point of view on this one. He has received such a call from POTUS already.
But, I think he and S had a good relationship and he may want to talk to her about his future career
goals.
Best,
J.

Obama hopes START treaty will pass Congress soon
(AFP) – 7 hours ago
WASHINGTON — US President Barack Obama Thursday said he hoped that a landmark nuclear weapons deal
with Russia would win Congress approval before the end of this year.
The new Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) was negotiated earlier this year to replace a similar treaty
which expired at the end of December.
Obama appealed to Republicans to help approve the treaty when Congress returns on November 15, after the
party put up stiff opposition to the new deal fearing it could hamper US missile defense plans.
""This is not a traditionally Democratic or Republican issue, but, rather, an issue of American national security,""
Obama said at a cabinet meeting, two days after Republicans posted strong gains in congressional elections.
""I'm hopeful that we can get that done.., and send a strong signal to Russia that we're serious about reducing
nuclear arsenals, but also send a signal to the world that we're serious about non-proliferation,"" Obama said.
The new Congress takes office in January, with Republicans set to take control of the House of Representatives
and to add members to the Senate. So the next two months are known as a ""lame duck"" session, in which
outgoing lawmakers often shy away from major legislation.
But START was facing trouble even in the current Congress. Under the US constitution, treaties need the
approval of two-thirds of the Senate.
The START treaty -- signed by Russian President Dmitry Medvedev and Obama at an elaborate ceremony in
Prague in April -- restricts each nation to a maximum of 1,550 deployed warheads, a cut of about 30 percent
from a limit set in 2002.
US Defense Secretary Robert Gates echoed Obama's appeal, urging the Senate to ratify a treaty to ensure the
resumption of inspections of Russia's arsenal.
His press secretary, Geoff Morrell, told reporters that Gates ""and many other former defense secretaries and
national security officials, from both parties, have frequently voiced their strong belief that this treaty is

absolutely critical to the effectiveness of our nuclear arsenal, our knowledge of Russian nuclear capabilities, and
US national security overall.""
In the Senate, the treaty enjoys the support of Richard Lugar, the top Republican on the Foreign Relations
Committee, along with several former Republican secretaries of state including Henry Kissinger.
But a growing number of Republicans have voiced opposition, saying it would impede the US ability to set up
missile defenses against future potential threats such as Iran.
Former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney, who is expected to seek the Republican nomination to run
against Obama in 2012, has led the charge criticizing START.

Subject: Tony Blair on the American Ideal
Americans can be all that the rest of the world sometimes accuses them of: brash, loud, insular, obsessive and heavy-
handed. But America is great for a reason. It is looked up to, despite all the criticism, for a reason. There is a nobility in
the American character that has been developed over the centuries, derived in part, no doubt, from the frontier spirit,
from the waves of migration that form the stock, from the circumstances of independence, from the Civil War, from a
myriad of historical facts and coincidences. But it is there.
That nobility isn't about being nicer, better or more successful than anyone else. It is a feeling about the country. It is a
devotion to the American ideal that at a certain point transcends class, race, religion or upbringing. That ideal is about
values: freedom, the rule of law, democracy. It is also about the way you achieve: on merit, by your own efforts and
hard work. But it is most of all that in striving for and protecting that ideal, you as an individual take second place to the

interests of the nation as a whole. It is what makes the country determined to overcome its challenges. It is what makes
its soldiers give their lives in sacrifice. It is what brings every variety of American, from the lowest to the highest, to their
feet when ""The Star-Spangled Banner"" is played. Of course the ideal is not always met — that is obvious. But it is always
striven for.
The Need for American Confidence
The next years will test the American character. America won't be loved in this presidency any more than in previous
ones. But America should have confidence. That ideal, which produces the optimism that generates the achievement, is
worth all the striving. it is the most precious gift a nation can have. The world is changing. New powers are emerging.
But this does not diminish the need for that American ideal. It reaffirms it, renews it, gives it added relevance. There is
always one, more prosaic, test of a nation's position: Are people trying to get into it, or to get out of it? I think we know
the answer to that in America's case, and that ideal is the reason.
A friend of mine whose parents were immigrants, Jews from Europe who came to America in search of safety, told me
this story. His parents lived and worked in New York. They were not well off. His father died when he was young. His
mother lived on, and in time my friend succeeded and became wealthy. He often used to offer his mother the chance to
travel outside America. She never did. When eventually she died, they went back to recover the safety box where she
kept her jewelry. They found there was another box. There was no key. So they had to drill it open. They wondered what
precious jewel must be in it. They lifted the lid. There was wrapping and more wrapping and finally an envelope.
Intrigued, they opened it. In the envelope were her U.S. citizenship papers. Nothing more. That was the jewel, more
precious to her than any other possession. That was what she treasured most. So should America today.

Cheryl,
One sappy statement before I fly. Your involvement in the QDDR process has always been extremely helpful. Most of the
best QDDR chairs meetings were those in which you participated, due in large part to the rigor and critical thought you
brought to every issue. From the beginning of the process, your critical analysis and thoughtfulness in these meetings
made all of us think more deeply. I have been grateful for that approach many times throughout the QDDR.
We've come a long way since that first meeting in which I described this as a ""capabilities review"" and organizational
change exercise — all met with some frustration or blank stares. I think we've ended this phase on a great note. The

amount of positive feedback we've received and the eagerness to start implementation are great signs heading into
implementation.
You are clearly one of the hardest working people in this building and have done so much to define and implement the
Secretary's vision on so many things. So thanks for everything you've done on the QDDR and for everything else you do.

Clearly I'm not the only one who has made these sacrifices or who has these frustrations; Secretary Clinton has heard

As requested, below is a brief bio (compiled by DRL, INR, and AF) of Kenyan Vice Minister for Foreign Affairs Richard
Momoima Onyonka, who you met in Krakow at the Community of Democracies. Please let me know if you would like

Richard Momoima Onyonka is a Kenyan politician and belongs to the People's Democratic Party. Born in 1962 and
hailing from the Bogeka clan, VM Momoima has lived in Otamba, Nyamataro, Mosocho and Nairobi. In 1982, following
the failed Kenyan coup d'etat attempt to overthrow President Daniel Arap Moi's government, VM Momoima was among
the 900 people that were jailed. However, in 1984, he returned to the University of Nairobi and graduated with a
Bachelors degree in commerce a year later. After graduation, VM Momoima attended North Carolina State University
where he graduated with a Masters degree in management. He returned to Kenya in 1992 during the first multi party
elections to help his father (then incumbent MP for Kitutu Chache and Minister for Planning and National Development)
who was seeking re-election on a KANU (Kenya African National Union) ticket. VM Momoima's first political opportunity
arose when his father passed away in 1996, which prompted an election in which he lost to a new corner during the

Chache Constituency in the National Assembly of Kenya.
A financial economist by profession, VM Momoima currently runs personal businesses in Nairobi and Kisii and has held
positions in the Kisii KANU branch. His priorities include economic empowerment, particularly for youth and women,
education, and poverty reduction.

Re: Latest on UK (5:15 pm, Friday, London); plus Euro and Tony
Everyone has their favorite scenario, but it seems fairly obvious that it will be almost impossible for Gordon to
hang on. This process may take some days. Jonathan, who knows Clegg, says he's basically not who his voters
think he is but a pro-Europeanist Tory. When Clegg was contemplating a political career he consulted Jonathan.
Clegg comes from a Tory family. Jonathan told him to become a Tory, join a real political party rather than the
Lib Dems, but Clegg thought he would advance further with LDs. So several theories: 1. Clegg makes an
outright deal with Cameron, including for some form of proportional representation (giving LDs more seats in
future elections) and cabinet positions. Clegg might become foreign secretary under this scenario. This is the
scenario Jonathan believes may well happen. 2. Clegg supports Cameron to form a minority government, but
doesn't go into a coalition. Instead his deal involves Cameron dropping almost the whole Tory program but a
joint program on financial recovery to be proposed in the Queen's Speech (equivalent of State of the Union). I
find this far-fetched. But who knows? 3. Clegg supports Cameron to form government, makes no deals.
Jonathan Freedland, who spent last week with Clegg, told me today that Clegg told him a deal with Gordon
would appear dirty. Yet making a deal with Cameron would also make Clegg to be a dealmaker, even without a
deal on program. These are the convolutions people are going through waiting for resolution. Then, Gordon:
Gordon is trying to figure out how to form a coalition. Clegg is refusing him. Gordon may propose Clegg's
maximum demands to him to see if he will publicly refuse them. Hard to know when this comes to a head and if
and when Gordon departs. Jonathan told me that Tony's view is that Gordon will go but that he couldn't see how
Gordon would understand it or exactly how he would go. Barring any clear process, skipping ahead, David
appears to be frontrunner for successor as leader of opposition. He would be well positioned to be the future PM
if he plays it right under these circumstances. More to come...
Also:
1. You might consider making a statement on Europe and the financial crisis, not a detailed policy statement but

a general statement, a little music to position support for Merkel, which she would greatly appreciate, especially
facing a harsh regional election in North Rhineland. I would make it short and sweet, simply something about
the US commitment to the European project, there from the beginning, is as strong and steadfast as ever; that
the US supports Merkel's efforts (and mention Sarkozy) to stabilize Europe and the Euro, etc. Timing TBD, but
soon.
2. Tony says he ready and willing to do more on the Middle East if you want to use him.

A REPORTER AT 1.ARGE
COVERT OPERATIONS
The billionaire brothers who are waging a war against Obama.
by Jane Mayetmo,
(.s..
David H. Koch in 1996. He and his brother Charles are lifelong libertarians and have quietly given more than a hundred million
dollars to right-wing causes.
On May 17th, a black-tie audience at the Metropolitan Opera House applauded as a tall, jovial-looking billionaire tOok the
stage. It was the seventieth annual spring gala of American Ballet Theatre, and David H. Koch was being celebrated for his
generosity as a member of the board of trustees; he had recently donated $2.5 million toward the company's upcoming season,
and had given many millions before that. Koch received an award while flanked by two of the gala's co-chairs, Blaine Trump,
in a peach-colored gown, and Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg, in emerald green. Kennedy's mother, Jacqueline Kennedy
Onassis, had been a patron of the ballet and, coincidentally, the previous owner of a Fifth Avenue apartment that Koch had
bought, in 1995, and then sold, eleven years later, for thirty-two million dollars, having found it too small.
The gala marked the social ascent of Koch, who, at the age of seventy, has become one of the city's most prominent
philanthropists. In 2008, he donated a hundred million dollars to modernize. Lincoln Center's New York State Theatre building,
which now bears his name. He has given twenty million to the American Museum of Natural History, whose dinosaur wing is
named for him. This spring, after noticing the decrepit state of the fountains outside the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Koch
pledged at least ten million dollars for their renovation. He is a trustee of the museum, perhaps the most coveted social prize in
the city, and serves on the board of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, where, after he donated more than forty million
dollars, an endowed chair and a research center were named for him.
One dignitary was conspicuously absent from the gala: the event's third honorary co-chair, Michelle Obama. Her office
said that a scheduling conflict had prevented her from attending. Yet had the First Lady shared the stage with Koch it might
have created an awkward tableau. In Washington, Koch is best known as part of a family that has repeatedly funded stealth
attacks on the federal government, and on the Obama Administration in particular.
With his brother Charles, who is seventy-four, David Koch owns virtually all of Koch Industries, a conglomerate,
headquartered in Wichita. Kansas, whose annual revenues are estimated to be a hundred billion dollars. The company has
grown spectacularly since their father, Fred, died, in 1967, and the brothers took charge. The Kochs operate oil refineries in
Alaska, Texas, and Minnesota, and control some four thousand miles of pipeline. Koch Industries owns Brawny paper towels,
Dixie. cups, Georgia-Pacific lumber, Staimnaster carpet, and Lycra, among other products. Forbes ranks it as the second-largest
private company in the country, after Cargill, and its consistent profitability has made David and Charles Koch—who, years
ago, bought out two other brothers—among the richest Men in America. Their combined fortune of thirty-five billion dollars is
exceeded only by those of Bill Gates and Warren Buffett.
The Kochs are longtime libertarians who believe in drastically lower personal and corporate taxes, minimal social services
for the needy, and much less oversight of industry—especially environmental regulation. These views dovetail with the
brothers' corporate interests. In a study released this spring, the University of Massachusetts at Amherst's Political Economy
Research Institute named Koch Industries one of the top ten air polluters in the United States.- And Greenpeace issued a report
identifying the company as a ""kingpin of climate science denial."" The report showed that, from 2005 to 2008, the Kochs vastly
outdid ExxonMobil in giving money to organizations fighting legislation related to climate change, unclerwriting'a huge
network of foundations, think tanks, and political front groups. Indeed, the brothers have funded opposition campaigns against
so many Obama Administration policies—from health-care reform to the economic-stimulus program----that, in political circles,
their ideological network is known as the Kochtopus.
In a statement, Koch Industries said that the Greenpeace report ""distorts the environmental record of our companies."" And. .
David Koch, in a recent, admiring article about him in New York, protested that the ""radical press"" had turned his family into
""whipping boys,"" and had exaggerated its influence on American politics. But Charles Lewis, the founder of the Center for
Public Integrity, a nonpartisan watchdog group, said, ""The Kochs are on a whole different level. There's no one else who has
spent this much money. The sheer dimension of it is what sets them apart. They have a pattern of lawbreaking, political
manipulation, and obfuscation. I've been in Washington since Watergate, and I've never seen anything like it. They are the
Standard Oil of our times.""
few weeks after the Lincoln Center gala, the advocacy wing of the Americans for Prosperity Foundation—an organization that
David Koch started, in 2004—held a different kind of gathering. Over the July 4th weekend, a summit called Texas Defending
the American Dream took place in a chilly hotel ballroom in Austin. Though Koch freely promotes his philanthropic ventures,
lie did not attend the summit, and his name was not in evidence. And on this occasion the audience was roused not by a,dance
performance but by a series of speakers denouncing President Barack Obama. Peggy Venable, the organizer of the summit,
warned that Administration officials ""have a socialist visiOn for this country.""
Five hundred people attended the summit, which served, in part, as a training session for Tea Party activists in Texas. An
advertisement cast the event as a populist uprising against vested corporate power. ""Today, the voices of average Americans are
being drowned out by lobbyists and special interests,"" it said. ""But you can do something about it."" The pitch made no mention
of its corporate funders. The White House has expressed frustration that such sponsors have largely eluded public notice. David .
Axelrod, Obama's senior adviser, said, ""What they don't say is that, in part, this is a grassroots citizens' movement brought to
you by a bunch of oil billionaires.""
In April, 2009, Melissa Cohlmia, a company spokesperson; denied that the Kochs had direct links to the Tea Party, saying
that Americans for Prosperity is ""an independent organization and Koch companies do not in any way direct their activities.""
.Later, she issued a statement: ""No funding has been provided by Koch companies, the Koch foundations, or Charles Koch or
David Koch specifically to support the tea parties."" David Koch told New York, ""I've never been to a tea-party event. No one
representing the tea party has ever even approached me.""
At the lectern in Austin, however, Venable—a longtime political operative who draws a salary from Americans for
Prosperity, and who has worked for Koch-funded political groups since 1994—spoke less warily: ""We love what the Tea
Parties are doing, because that's how we're going to take back America!"" she declared, as the crowd cheered. In a subsequent
interview, she described herself as an early member of the movement, joking, ""I was part of the Tea Party before it was cool!""
She explained that the role of Americans for Prosperity was to help ""educate"" Tea Party activists on policy details, and to give
them ""next-step training"" after their rallies, so that their political energy could be channelled ""more effectively."" And she noted
that Americans for Prosperity had provided Tea Party activists with lists of elected officials to target. She said of the Kochs.
""They're certainly our people. David's the chairman of our board. I've certainly met with them, and I'm very appreciative Of
what they do.""
Venable honored several Tea Party ""citizen leaders"" at the summit. The Texas branch of Americans for Prosperity gave its
Blogger of the Year Award to a young woman named Sibyl West. On June 14th, West, writing on her site, described Obama as
the ""cokehead in chief."" In an online thread, West speculated that the President was exhibiting symptoms of ""demonic
possession (aka schizophrenia, etc.)."" The summit featured several paid speakers, including Janine Turner, the actress best
known for her role on the television series ""Northern Exposure."" She declared, ""They don't want our children to know about
their rights. They don't want our children to know about a God!""
During a catered lunch, Venable introduced Ted Cruz, a former solicitor general of Texas, who told the crowd that Obama
was ""the most radical President ever to occupy the Oval Office,"" and had hidden from voters a secret agenda—""the government
taking over our economy and our lives."" Countering Obama, Cruz proclaimed, was the epic fight of our generation!"" As the
crowd rose to its feet and cheered, he quoted the defiant words of a Texan at the Alamo: ""Victory, or death!""
Americans for Prosperity has worked closely with the Tea Party since the movement's inception. In the weeks before the
first Tax Day protests, in April, 2009, Americans for Prosperity hosted a Web site offering supporters ""Tea Party Talking
Points."" The Arizona branch urged people to send tea bags to Obama; the Missouri branch urged members to sign up for
""Taxpayer Tea Party Registration"" and provided directions to nine protests. The group continues to stoke the rebellion. The
North Carolina branch recently launched a ""Tea Party Finder"" Web site, advertised as ""a hub for all the Tea Parties in North
Carolina.""
The anti-government fervor infusing the 2010 elections represents a political triumph for the Kochs. By giving money to
""educate,"" fund, and organize Tea Party protesters, they have helped turn their private agenda into a mass movement. Bruce
Bartlett, a conservative economist and a historian, who once worked at the National Center for Policy Analysis, a Dallas-based
think tank that the Kochs fund, said, ""The problem with the whole libertarian movement is that it's been all chiefs and no
Indians. There haven't been any actual people, like voters, who give a crap about it. So the problem for the Kochs has been
trying to create a movement."" With the emergence of the Tea Party, he said, ""everyone suddenly sees that for the first time there
are Indians out there—people who can provide real ideological power."" The Kochs, he said, are ""trying to shape and control and
channel the populist uprising into their own policies.""-
A Republican campaign consultant who has done research on behalf of Charles and David Koch said of the Tea Party, ""The
Koch brothers gave the money that founded it. It's like they put the seeds in the ground. Then the rainstorm comes, and the
frogs come out of the mud—and they're our candidates!""
The Kochs and their political operatives declined requests for interviews. Instead, a prominent New York public-relations
executive who is close with the Kochs put forward two friends: George Pataki, the former governor of New York, and Mortimer
Zuckerman, the publisher and real-estate magnate. Pataki, a Republican who received campaign donations from David Koch,
called him ""a patriot who cares deeply about his country."" Zuckerman praised David's ""gentle decency"" and the ""range of his
public interests.""
The Republican campaign consultant said of the family's political activities, ""To call them under the radar is an
understatement. They are underground!"" Another former Koch adviser said, ""They're smart. This right-wing, redneck stuff
works for them. They see this as a way to get things done without getting dirty themselves."" Rob Stein, a Democratic political
strategist who has studied the conservative movement's finances, said that the Kochs are ""at the epicenter of the anti-Obama
movement. But it's not just about Obama. They would have done the same to Hillary Clinton. They did the same with Bill •
Clinton. They are out to destroy progressivism.""
ddly enough, the fiercely capitalist Koch family owes part of its fortune to Joseph Stalin. Fred Koch was the son of a Dutch
printer who settled in Texas and ran a weekly newspaper. Fred attended M.I.T., where he earned a degree in chemical
engineering. In 1927, he invented a more efficient process for converting oil into gasoline; but, according to family lore,
America's major oil companies regarded him as a threat and shut him out of the industry. Unable to succeed at home, Koch
found work in the Soviet Union. In the nineteen-thirties, his company trained Bolshevik engineers and helped Stalin's regime
set up fifteen modern oil refineries. Over time, however, Stalin brutally purged several of Koch's Soviet colleagues. Koch was
deeply affected by the experience, and regretted his collaboration. He returned to the U.S. In the headquarters of his company,
Rock Island Oil & Refining, in Wichita, he kept photographs aimed at proving that some of those Soviet refineries had been
destroyed in the Second World War. Gus diZerega, a former friend of Charles Koch, recalled, ""As the Soviets became a
stronger military power, Fred felt a certain amount of guilt at having helped build them up. I think it bothered him a lot.""
In 1958, Fred Koch became one of the original members of the john Birch Society, the arch-conservative group known, in
part, for a highly skeptical view of governance and for spreading fears of a Communist takeover. Members considered President
Dwight D. Eisenhower to be a Communist agent. In a self-published broadside, Koch claimed that the Communists have
infiltrated both the Democrat and Republican Parties."" He wrote admiringly of Benito Mussolini's suppression of Communists
in Italy, and disparagingly of the American civil-rights movement. ""The colored man looms large in the Communist plan to take
over America,"" he warned. Welfare was a secret plot to attract rural blacks to cities, where they would foment ""a vicious race
war."" In a 1963 speech that prefigures the Tea Party's talk of a secret 'socialist plot, Koch predicted that Communists would
""infiltrate the highest offices of government in the U.S. until the President is a Communist, unknown to the rest of us.""
Koch married Mary Robinson, the daughter of a Missouri physician, and they had four sons: Freddie, Charles, and twins,
David and William. John Damgard, the president of the Futures Industry Association, was David's schoolmate and friend. He
recalled that Fred Koch was ""a real John Wayne type."" Koch emphasized rugged pursuits, taking his sons big-game hunting in
Africa, and requiring them to do farm labor at the family ranch. The Kochs lived in a stone mansion on a large compound across
from Wichita's country club; in the summer, the boys could hear their friends splashing in the pool, but they were not allowed
to join them. ""By instilling a work ethie in me at an early age, my father did me a big favor, although it didn't seem like a favor
back then,"" Charles has written. ""By the time I was eight, he made sure work occupied most of my spare time."" David Koch
recalled that his father also indoctrinated the boys politically. ""He was constantly speaking to us children about what was wrong
with government,"" he told Brian Doherty, an editor of the libertarian magazine Reason, and the author of ""Radicals for
Capitalism,"" a 2007 history of the libertarian movement. ""It's something I grew up with—a fundamental point of view that big
government was bad, and imposition of government controls on our lives and economic fortunes was not good.""
David attended Deerfield Academy, in Massachusetts, and Charles was sent to military school. Charles, David, and William
all earned engineering degrees at their father's alma mater, M.I.T., and later joined the family company. Charles eventually
assumed control, with David as his deputy; William's career at the company was less successful. Freddie went to Harvard and
studied playwriting at the Yale School of Drama. His father reportedly disapproved of him, and punished him financially.
(Freddie, through a spokesperson, denied this:)
In 1967, after Fred Koch died, of a heart attack, Charles renamed the business Koch Industries, in honor of his father. Fred
Koch's will made his sons extraordinarily wealthy. David Koch joked about his good fortune in a 2003 speech to alumni at
Deerfield, where, after pledging twenty-five million dollars, he was made the school's sole ""lifetime trustee."" He said, ""You
might ask: How does David Koch happen to have the wealth to be so generous? Well, let me tell you a story. It all started when
I was alittle boy. One day, my father gave me an apple. I soon sold it for five dollars and bought two apples and sold them for
ten. Then I bought four apples and sold them for twenty. Well, this went on day after day, week after week, month after month,
year after year, until my father died and left me three hundred million dollars!""
David and Charles had absorbed their father's conservative politics, but they did not share all his views, according to
diZerega, who befriended Charles in the mid-sixties, after meeting him while browsing in a John Birch Society bookstore in
Wichita. Charles eventually invited him to the Kochs' mansion, to participate in an informal political-discussion group. ""It was
pretty clear that Charles thought some of the Birch Society was bullshit,"" diZerega recalled.
DiZerega, who has lost touch with Charles, eventually abandOned right-wing views, and became a political-science
professor. He credits Charles with opening his mind to political philosophy, which set him on the path to academia; Charles is
one of three people to whom he dedicated his first book. But diZerega believes that the Koch brothers have followed a wayward
intellectual trajectory, transferring their father's paranoia about Soviet Communism to a distrust of the U.S. government, and
seeing its expansion, beginning with the New Deal, as a tyrannical threat to freedom. In an essay, posted on Beliefnet, diZerega
writes, ""As state socialism failed ... the target for many within these organizations shifted to any kind of regulation at all.
'Socialism' kept. being defined downwards.""
Members of the. John Birch Society developed.an interest in a school of Austrian economists who promoted free-market
ideals. Charles and David Koch were particularly influenced by the work of Friedrich von Hayek, the author of ""The Road to
Serfdom"" (1944), which argued that centralized government planning led, inexorably, to totalitarianism. Hayek'S belief in
unfettered capitalism has proved inspirational to many conservatives, and to anti-Soviet dissidents; lately, Tea Party supporters
have championed his work. In June, the talk-radio host Glenn Beck, who has supported the Tea Party rebellion, promoted ""The
Road to Serfdom"" on his show; the paperback soon became a No. 1 best-seller on Amazon. (Beck appears to be a fan of the
Kochs; in the midst of arecent on-air parody of Al Gore, Beck said, without explanation, ""I want to thank Charles Koch for this
information."" Beck declined to elaborate on the relationship.)
Charles and David also became devotees of a more radical thinker, Robert LeFevre, who favored the abolition of the state
but didn't like the label ""anarchist""; he called himself an ""autarchist."" LeFevre liked to say that ""government is a disease
masquerading as its own cure."" In 1956, he opened an institution called the Freedom School, in Colorado Springs. Brian
Doherty, of Reason, told me that ""LeFevre was an anarchist figure who won Charles's heart,"" and that the school was ""a tiny
world of people who thought the New Deal was a horrible mistake."" According to diZerega, Charles supported the school
financially, and even gave him money to take classes there.
Throughout the seventies, Charles and David continued to build Koch Industries. In 1980, William, with assistance from
Freddie, attempted to take over the company from Charles, who, they felt, had assumed autocratic control. In retaliation, the
company's board, which answered to Charles, fired William. (""Charles runs it all with an iron hand,"" Bruce Bartlett, the
economist, told me.) Lawsuits were filed, with William and Freddie on one side and Charles and David on the other. In 1983,
Charles and David bought out their brothers' share in the company for nearly a billion dollars. But the antagonism remained,
and litigation continued for seventeen more years, with the brothers hiring rival private investigators; in 1990, they walked past
one another with stony expressions at their mother's funeral. Eventually. Freddie moved to Monaco, which has no income tax.
He bought historic, estates in France. Austria, and elsewhere, filling them with art, antiques, opera scores, and literary
manuscripts. William founded his own energy company, Oxbow, and turned to yachting; he spent an estimated sixty-five
million dollars to win the America's Cup, in 1992.
With Charles as the undisputed chairman and C.E.O., Koch Industries expanded rapidly. Roger Altman, who heads the
investment-banking firm Evercore, told me that the company's performance has been ""beyond phenomenal."" Charles remained
in Wichita, with his wife and two children, guarding his privacy while supporting community charities. David moved to New
York City, where he is an executive vice-president of the company and the C.E.O. of its Chemical Technology Group. A
financial expert who knows Koch Industries well told me, ""Charles is the company. Charles runs it."" David, described by
associates as ""affable"" and ""a bit of a lunk,"" enjoyed for years the life of a wealthy bachelor. He rented a yacht in the South of
France and bought a waterfront home in Southampton, where he threw parties that the Web site New York Social Diary likened
to an ""East Coast version of Hugh Hefher's soirees."" In 1996, he married Julia Flesher, a fashion assistant. They live in a nine-
thousand-square-foot duplex at 740 Park Avenue, with their three children. Though David's manner is more cosmopolitan, and
more genial, than that of Charles, Brian Doherty, who has interviewed both brothers, couldn't think of a single issue on which
the brothers disagreed.
As their fortunes grew, Charles and David Koch became the primary underwriters of hard-line libertarian politics in
America. Charles's goal, as Doherty described it, was to tear the government ""out at the root."" The brothers' first major public
step came in 1979, when Charles persuaded David, then thirty-nine, to run for public office. They had become supporters of the
Libertarian Party, and were backing its Presidential candidate, Ed Clark, who was running against Ronald Reagan from the
right. Frustrated by the legal limits on campaign donations, they contrived to place David on the ticket, in the Vice-Presidential
slot; upon becoming a candidate, he could lavish as much of his personal fortune as he wished on the campaign. The ticket's
slogan was ""The Libertarian Party has only one source of funds: You."" In fact, its primary source of funds was David Koch,
who spent more than two million dollars on the effort.
Many of the ideas propounded in the 1980 campaign presaged the Tea Party movement. Ed Clark told The Nation that
libertarians were getting ready to stage ""a very big tea party,"" because people were ""sick to death"" of taxes. The Libertarian
Party platform called for the abolition of the F.B.I. and the C.I.A., as well as of federal regulatory agencies, such as the
Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Energy. The Party wanted to end Social Security, minimum-wage
laws, gun control, and all personal and corporate income taxes; it proposed the legalization of prostitution, recreational drugs,
and suicide. Government should be reduced to only one function: the protection of individual rights. William F. Buckley, Jr., a
more traditional conservative, called the movement ""Anarcho-Totalitarianism.""
That November, the Libertarian ticket received only one per cent of the vote. The brothers realized that their brand of
politics didn't sell at the ballot box. Charles Koch became openly scornful of conventional politics. ""It tends to be a nasty,
corrupting business,"" he told a reporter at the time. ""I'm interested in advancing libertarian ideas."" According to Doherty's
book, the .Kochs came to regard elected politicians as merely ""actors playing out a script."" A longtime confidant of the Kochs
told Doherty that the brothers wanted to ""supply the themes and words for the scripts."" In order to alter the direction of
America, they had to ""influence the areas where policy ideas percolate from: academia. and think tanks.""
fter the 1980 election, Charles and David Koch receded from the public arena. But they poured more than a hundred million
. dollars into dozens of seemingly independent organizations. Tax records indicate that in 2008 the three main Koch family
foundations gave money.to thirty-four political and policy organizations, three of which they founded, and several of which
they direct. The Kochs and their company have given additional millions to political campaigns, advocacy groups, and
lobbyists. The family's subterranean financial role has fuelled suspicion on the left: Lee Fang, of the liberal blog ThinkProgress,
has called the Kochs the billionaires behind the hate.""
Only the Kochs know precisely how much they have spent on politics. Public tax records show that between 1998 and 2008
the Charles G. Koch Charitable Foundation spent more than forty-eight million dollars. The Claude R. Lambe Charitable
Foundation, which is controlled by Charles Koch and his wife, along with two company employees and an accountant, spent
more than twenty-eight million. The David H. Koch Charitable Foundation spent more than a hundred and twenty million.
Meanwhile, since 1998 Koch Industries has spent more than fifty million dollars on lobbying. Separately, the company's
political-action committee, KochPAC, has donated some eight million dollars to political campaigns, more than eighty
per cent of it to Republicans. So far in 2010, Koch Industries leads all other energy companies in political
contributions, as it has since 2006. In addition, during the past dozen years the Kochs and other family members
have personally spent more than two million dollars on political contributions. In the second quarter of 2010, David
Koch was the biggest individual contributor to the Republican Governors Association, with a million-dollar donation.
Other gifts by the Kochs may be untraceable; federal tax law permits anonymous personal donations to politically
active nonprofit groups.
In recent decades, members of several industrial dynasties have spent parts of their fortunes on a conservative agenda. In
the nineteen-eighties, the Olin family, which owns a chemicals-and-manufacturing conglomerate, became known for funding
right-leaning thinking in academia, particularly in law schools. And during the nineties Richard Mellon Scaife, a descendant of
Andrew Mellon, spent millions attempting to discredit President Bill Clinton. An Rabin-Havt, a vice-president at the
Democratic-leaning Web site Media Matters, said that the Kochs' effort is Unusual, in its marshalling of corporate and personal
funds: ""Their role, in terms of financial commitments, is staggering.""
Of course, Democrats give money, too. Their most prominent donor, the financier George Soros, runs a foundation, the
Open Society Institute, that has spent as much as a hundred million dollars a year in America. Soros has also made generous
private contributions to various Democratic campaigns, including Obama's. But Michael Vachon, his spokesman, argued that
Soros's giving is transparent, and that ""none of his contributions are in the service of his own economic interests."" The Kochs
have given millions of dollars to nonprofit groups that criticize environmental regulation and support lower taxes for industry.
Gus diZerega, the former friend, suggested that the Kochs' youthful idealism about libertarianism had largely devolved into a
rationale for corporate self-interest. He said of Charles, ""Perhaps he has confused making money with freedom.""
Some critics have suggested that the Kochs' approach has subverted the purpose of tax-exempt giving. By law, charitable
foundations must conduct exclusively nonpartisan activities that promote the public welfare. A 2004 report by the National
Committee for Responsive Philanthropy, a watchdog group, described the Kochs' foundations as being self-serving,
concluding, ""These foundations give money to nonprofit organizations that do research and advocacy on issues that impact the
profit margin of Koch Industries.""
The Kochs have gone well beyond their immediate self-interest, however, funding organizations that aim to push the
country in a libertarian. direction. Among the institutions that they have subsidized are the Institute for Justice, which files.
lawsuits opposing state and federal regulations; the Institute for Humane Studies, which underwrites libertarian academics; and
the Bill of Rights Institute, which promotes a conservative slant on the Constitution. Many of the organizations funded by the
Kochs employ specialists who write position Papers that are subsequently quoted by politicians and pundits. David Koch has
acknowledged that the family exerts tight ideological control. ""If we're going to give a lot of money, we'll make darn sure they •
spend it in a way that goes along with our intent,"" he told Doherty. ""And if they make a wrong turn and start doing things we
don't agree with, we withdraw funding.""
he Kochs' subsidization of a pro-corporate movement fulfills, in many ways, the vision laid out in a secret 1971 memo that
Lewis Powell. then a Virginia attorney, wrote two months before he was nominated to the Supreme Court. The antiwar
movement had turned its anger on defense contractors, such as Dow Chemical, and Ralph Nader was leading a public-interest
crusade against corporations. Powell, writing a report for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, urged American companies to fight
back. The greatest threat to free enterprise, he warned, was not Communism or the New Left but, rather, ""respectable elements
of society""—intellectuals, journalists, and scientists. To defeat them, he wrote, business leaders needed to wage a long-term,
• unified campaign to change public opinion.
Charles Koch seems to have approached both business and politics with the deliberation of an engineer. ""To bring about
social change,"" he told Doherty, requires ""a strategy"" that is ""vertically and horizontally integrated,"" spanning ""from idea
creation to policy development to education to grassroots organizations to lobbying to litigation to political action."" The project,
he admitted, was extremely ambitious. ""We have a radical philosophy,"" he said.
In 1977, the Kochs provided the funds to launch the nation's first libertarian think tank, the Cato Institute. According to the
'Center for Public Integrity, between 1986 and 1993 the Koch family gave eleven million dollars to the institute. Today Cato
has more than a hundred full-time employees, and its experts and policy papers are widely quoted and respected by the
mainstream media. It describes itself as nonpartisan, and its scholars have at times been critical of both parties. But it has
consistently pushed for corporate tax cuts, reductions in social services, and laissez-faire environmental policies.
When President Obama, in a 2008 speech, described the science on global warming as ""beyond dispute,"" the Cato Institute
took out a full-page ad in the Times to contradict him. Cato's resident scholars have relentlessly criticized political attempts to
stop global warming as expensive, ineffective, and unnecessary. Ed Crane, the Cato Institute's founder and president, told me
that ""global-warming theories give the government more control of the economy.""
Cato scholars have been particularly energetic in promoting the Climategate scandal. Last year, private e-mails of climate
scientists at the University of East Anglia, in England, were mysteriously leaked, and their exchanges appeared to suggest a
willingness to falsify data in order to buttress the idea that global warming is real. In the two weeks after the e-mails went
public, one Cato scholar gave more than twenty media interviews trumpeting the alleged scandal. But five independent inquiries
have since exonerated the researchers, and nothing was found in their e-mails or data to discredit the scientific consensus on
global warming. •
Nevertheless, the controversy succeeded in spreading skepticism about climate change. Even though the National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration recently issued a report concluding that the evidence for global warming is unequivocal, more
Americans are convinced than at any time since 1997 that scientists have exaggerated the seriousness of global warming. The
Kochs promote this statistic on their company's Web site but do not mention the role that their funding has played in fostering
such doubt.
In a 2002 memo, the Republican political consultant Frank Luntz wrote that so long as ""voters believe there is no consensus
about global warming within the scientific community' the status quo would prevail. The key for opponents of environmental
reform, he said, was to question the science—a public-relations strategy that the tobacco industry used effectively for years to
forestall regulation. The Kochs have funded many sources of environmental skepticism, such as the Heritage Foundation, which
has argued that ""scientific facts gathered in the past 10 years do not support the notion of catastrophic human-made warming.""
The brothers have given money to more obscure groups, too, such as the Independent Women's Forum, which opposes the
presentation of global warming as a scientific fact in American public schools. Until 2008, the group was run by Nancy
Pfotenhauer, a former lobbyist for Koch Industries. Mary Beth Jarvis, a vice-president of a Koch subsidiary, is on the group's
board.
Naomi Oreskes, a professor of history and science studies at the University of California, San Diego, is the co-author of
""Merchants of Doubt,"" a new book that chronicles various attempts by American industry to manipulate public opinion on
science. She noted that the Kochs, as the heads of ""a company with refineries and pipelines,"" have ""a lot at stake."" She added,
""If the answer is to phase out fossil fuels, a different group of people are going to be making money, so we shouldn't be
surprised that they're fighting tooth and nail.""
David Koch told New York that he was unconvinced that global warming has been caused by human activity. Even if it has
been, he said, the heating of the planet will be beneficial, resulting in longer growing seasons in the Northern Hemisphere. ""The
Earth will be able to support enormously more people because far greater land area will be available to produce food,"" he said.
n the mid-eighties, the Kochs provided millions of dollars to George Mason University, in Arlington, Virginia, to set up another
think tank. Now known as the Mercatus Center, it promotes itself as ""the world's premier university source for market-oriented
ideas—bridging the gap between academic ideas and real-world problems."" Financial records show that the Koch family
foundations have contributed more than thirty million dollar's to George Mason, much of which has gone to the Mercatus
Center, a nonprofit organization. ""It's ground zero for deregulation policy in Washington,"" Rob Stein, the Democratic strategist,
said. It is an unusual arrangement. ""George Mason is a public university, and receives public funds,"" Stein noted. ""Virginia is
hosting an institution that the Kochs practically control.""
The founder of the Mercatus Center is Richard Fink, formerly an economist. Fink heads Koch Industries' lobbying
operation in Washington. In addition, he is the president of the Charles G. Koch Charitable Foundation, the president of the
Claude R. Lambe Charitable Foundation, a director of the Fred C. and Mary R. Koch Foundation, and a director and co-
founder, with David Koch, of the Americans for Prosperity Foundation.
Fink, with his many titles, has become the central nervous system of the Kochtopus. He appears to have supplanted Ed
Crane, the head of the Cato Institute, as the brothers' main political lieutenant. Though David remains on the board at Cato,
Charles Koch has fallen out with Crane. Associates suggested to me that Crane had been insufficiently respectful of Charles's
management philosophy, which he distilled into a book called ""The Science of Success,"" and trademarked under the name
Market-Based Management, or M.B.M. In the book. Charles recommends instilling a company's corporate culture with the
competitiveness of the marketplace.. Koch describes M.B.M. as a ""holistic system"" containing ""five dimensions: vision, virtue
and talents, knowledge processes, decision rights and incentives."" A top Cato Institute official told me that Charles ""thinks he's
a genius. He's the emperor, and he's convinced he's wearing clothes."" Fink, by contrast, has been far more embracing of
Charles's ideas. (Fink, like the Kochs, declined to. be interviewed.)
At a 1995 conference for philanthropfsts, Fink adopted the language of economics when speaking about the Mercatus
Center's purpose. He said that grant-makers should use think tanks and political-action groups to convert intellectual raw
materials into policy ""products.""
The Wall Street Journal has called the Mercatus Center ""the most important think tank you've never heard of,"" and noted
that fourteen of the twenty-three regulations that President George W. Bush placed on a ""hit list"" had been suggested first by
Mercatus scholars. Fink told the paper that the Kochs have ""other means of fighting [their] battles,"" and that the Mercatus
Center does riot actively promote the company's private interests. But Thomas McGarity, a law professor at the University of
Texas, who specializes in environmental issues, told me that ""Koch has been constantly in trouble with the E.P.A., and
Mercatus has constantly hammered on the agency."" An environmental lawyer who has clashed with the Mercatus Center called
it ""a means of laundering economic aims."" The lawyer explained the strategy: ""You take corporate money and give it to a
neutral-sounding think tank,"" which ""hires people with pedigrees and academic degrees who put out credible-seeming studies.
But they all coincide perfectly with the economic interests of their funders.""
In 1997, for instance, the E.P.A. moved to reduce surface ozone, a form of pollution caused, in part, by emissions from oil
refineries. Susan Dudley, an economist who became a top official at the 'Mercatus Center, criticized the proposed rule. The
E.P.A., she argued, had not taken into account that smog-free skies would result in more cases of skin cancer. She projected that
if pollution were controlled it would cause up to eleven thousand additional cases of skin cancer each year.
In 1999, the District of Columbia Circuit Court took 'up Dudley's smog argument. Evaluating the E.P.A. rule, the court
found that the E.P.A. had ""explicitly disregarded"" the ""possible health benefits of ozone."" In another part of the opinion, the
court ruled, 2-1, that the E.P.A. had overstepped its authority in calibrating standards for ozone emissions. As the Constitutional
Accountability Center, a think tank, revealed, the judges in the majority had previously attended legal junkets, on a Montana
ranch, that were arranged by the Foundation for Research on Economics and the Environment—a group funded by Koch family
foundations. The judges have claimed that the ruling was unaffected by their attendance.
deas don't happen on their own,"" Matt Kibbe, the president of Freedom Works, a Tea Party advocacy group, told me.
""Throughout history, ideas need patrons."" The Koch brothers, after helping to create Cato and Mercatus, concluded that think
tanks alone were not enough to effect change. They needed a mechanism to deliver those ideas to the street, and to attract the
public's support. in 1984, David Koch and Richard Fink created yet another organization. and Kibbe joined them. The group,
Citizens for a Sound Economy, seemed like a grassroots movement, but according to the Center for Public Integrity it was
sponsored principally by the Kochs, who provided $7.9 million between 1986 and 19.93. Its mission, Kibbe said, ""was to take
these heavy ideas and translate them for mass America.... We read the same literature Obama did about nonviolent
revolutions--Saul _Minsky, Gandhi, Martin Luther King. We studied the idea of the Boston Tea Party as an example of
nonviolent social change. We learned we needed boots on the ground to sell ideas, not candidates."" Within a few years, the
group had mobilized fifty paid field workers, in twenty-six states, to rally voters behind the Kochs' agenda. David and Charles,
according to one participant, were ""very controlling, very top down. You can't build an organization with them. They run it.""
Around this time, the brothers faced a political crisis. In 1989, the Senate Select Committee on Indian Affairs investigated
their business and released a scathing report accusing Koch Oil of ""a widespread and sophisticated scheme to steal crude oil
from Indians and others through fraudulent mismeasuring."" The Kochs admitted that they had improperly taken thirty-one
million dollars' worth of crude oil, but said that it had been accidental. Charles Koch told committee investigators that oil
measurement is ""a very uncertain art.""
To defend its reputation, Koch IndustrieS hired Robert Strauss, then a premier Washington lobbyist; the company soon
opened an office in the city. A grand jury was convened to investigate the allegations, but it eventually disbanded, without
issuing criminal charges. According to the Senate report, after the committee hearings Koch operatives delved into the personal
lives of committee staffers, even questioning an ex-wife. Senate investigators were upset by the Kochs' tactics. Kenneth Batten,
the counsel to the Senate committee, said, ""These people have amassed such unaccountable power!'
.'
By •1993, when Bill Clinton became President, Citizens for a Sound Economy had become a prototype for the kind of
corporate-backed opposition campaigns that have proliferated during the Obama era. The group waged a successful assault on
Clinton's proposed B.T.U. tax on energy, for instance, running advertisements, staging media events, and targeting opponents.
And it mobilized anti-tax rallies outside the Capitol—rallies that NPR described as ""designed to strike fear into the hearts of
wavering Democrats."" Dan Glickman, a former Democratic congressman from Wichita, who supported the B.I.U. tax, recalled,
""I'd been in Congress eighteen years. The Kochs actually engaged against me and funded my opponent. They used a lot of
'resources and effort—their employees, too."" Glickman suffered a surprise defeat. ""I can't prove it, but I think I was probably
their victim,"" he said.
The Kochs continued to disperse their money, creating slippery organizations with generic-sounding names, and this made
it difficult to ascertain the extent of their influence in Washington. In 1990, Citizens for a Sound Economy created a spinoff
group, Citizens for the Environment, which called acid rain and other environmental problems ""myths."" When the
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette investigated the matter, it discovered that the spinoff group had ""no citizen membership of its own.""
In 1997, another Senate investigation began looking into what a minority report called ""an audacious plan to pour millions
of dollars in contributions into Republican campaigns nationwide without disclosing the amount or source,"" in order to evade
campaign-finance laws. A shell corporation, Triad Management, had paid more than three million dollars for attack ads in
twenty-six House races and three Senate races. More than half of the advertising money came from an obscure nonprofit group,
the Economic Education Trust. The Senate committee's minority report suggested that ""the trust was financed in whole or in
part by Charles and David Koch of Wichita, Kansas."" The brothers were suspected of having secretly paid for the attack ads,
most of which aired in states where Koch Industries did business. In Kansas, where Triad Management was especially active,
the funds may have played a decisive role in four of six federal races. The Kochs, when asked by reporters if they had given the
money, refused to comment. In i998, however, the Wall Street Journal confirmed that a consultant on the Kochs' payroll had
been involved in the scheme. Charles Lewis, of the Center for Public Integrity, described the scandal as ""historic. Triad was the
first time a major corporation used a cutout""—a front operation—""in a threatening way. Koch Industries was the poster child of
a company run amok.""
uring the Clinton Administration, the energy industry faced increased scrutiny and regulation. In the mid-nineties, the Justice
Department filed two lawsuits against Koch Industries, claiming that it was responsible for more than three hundred oil spills,
which had released an estimated three million gallons of oil into lakes and rivers. The penalty was potentially as high as two
hundred and fourteen million dollars. In a settlement. Koch Industries paid a record thirty-million-dollar civil fine, and agreed to
spend five million dollars on environmental projects.
In 1999, a jury found Koch Industries guilty of negligence and malice in the deaths of two Texas teen-agers in an explosion
that resulted from a leaky underground butane pipeline. (In 2001, the company paid an undisclosed settlement.) And in the final
months of the Clinton Presidency the Justice Department levelled a ninety-seven-count indictment against the company, for
covering up the discharge of ninety-one tons of benzene, a carcinogen, from its refinery in Corpus Christi, Texas. The company
was liable •for three hundred and fifty million dollars in fines, and four Koch employees faced up to thirty-five years in prison.
The Koch Petroleum Group eventually pleaded guilty to one criminal charge of covering up environmental violations, including
the falsification of documents, and paid a twenty-million-dollar fine. David Uhlmann, a career prosecutor who, at the time,
headed the environmental-crimes section at the Justice Department, described the suit as ""one of the most significant cases ever
brought under the Clean Air Act."" He added, ""Environmental crimes are almost always motivated by economics and arrogance,
and in the Koch case there was a healthy dose of both.""
During the 2000 election campaign, Koch Industries spent some nine hundred thousand dollars to support the candidacies
of George W. Bush and other Republicans. During the Bush years, Koch Industries and other fossil-fuel companies enjoyed
remarkable prosperity. The 2005 energy bill, which Hillary Clinton dubbed the Dick Cheney Lobbyist Energy Bill, offered
enormous subsidies and tax breaks for energy companies. The Kochs have cast themselves as deficit hawks, but, according to a
study by Media Matters, their companies have benefitted from nearly a hundred million dollars in government contracts since
2000.
In 2004, Citizens for a Sound Economy was accused of illegitimately throwing its weight behind Bush's reelection. The
group's Oregon branch had attempted to get Ralph Nader on the Presidential ballot, in order to dilute Democratic support for
John Kerry. Critics argued that it was illegal, for a tax-exempt nonprofit organization to donate its services for partisan political
purposes. (A complaint was filed with the Federal Election Commission; it was dismissed.)
That year, internal rivalries at Citizens for a Sound Economy caused the organization to split apart. David Koch and Fink
started a new group, Americans for Prosperity, and they hired Tim Phillips to run it. Phillips was a political veteran who had
worked with Ralph Reed, the evangelical leader and Republican activist, co-founding Century Strategies, a campaign-
consulting company that became notorious for its ties to the disgraced lobbyist Jack Abramoff. Phillips's online biography
describes him as an expert in ""grasstops"" and ""grassroots"" political organizing. The Kochs' choice of Phillips signalled an even
greater toughness. The conservative operative Grover Norquist, who is known for praising ""throat slitters"" in politics, called
Phillips ""a grownup who can make things happen.""
Last year, Phillips told the Financial Times that Americans for Prosperity had only eight thousand registered members.
Currently, its Web site claims that the group has ""1.2 million activists."" Whatever its size, the Kochs' political involvement has
been intense; a former employee of the Cato Institute told me that Americans for Prosperity ""was micromanaged by the Kochs.""
And the brothers' investment may well have paid off: Americans for Prosperity, in concert with the family's other
organizations, has been instrumental in disrupting the Obama Presidency.
In January, 2008, Charles Koch wrote in his company newsletter that America could be on the verge of ""the greatest loss of
liberty and prosperity since the 1930s."" That October, Americans for Prosperity held a conference of conservative operatives at
a Marriott hotel outside Washington. Erick Erickson, the editor-in-chief of the conservative blog RedState.com, took the lectern,
thanked David Koch, and vowed to ""unite and fiaht ... the armies of the left!"" Sodn after Obama assumed office, Americans
for Prosperity launched ""Porkulus"" rallies against Obama's stimulus-spending measures. Then the Mercatus Center released a
report claiming that stimulus funds had been directed disproportionately toward Democratic districts; eventually, the author was
forced to correct the report, but not before Rush Limbaugh, citing.the paper, had labelled Obama's program ""a slush fund,"" and
Fox News and other conservative outlets had echoed the sentiment. (Phil Kerpen, the vice-president for policy at Americans for
Prosperity, is a contributor to the Fox News Web site. Another officer at Americans for Prosperity, Walter Williams, often
guest-hosts for Limbaugh.)
Americans for Prosperity also created an offshoot, Patients United Now, which organized what Phillips has estimated to be
more than three hundred rallies against health-care reform. Atone rally, an effigy of a Democratic congressman was hung; at
another, protesters unfurled a banner depicting corpses from Dachau. The group also helped organize the ""Kill the Bill"" protests
outside the Capitol, in March, where Democratic supporters of health-care reform alleged that they were spat on and cursed at.
Phillips was a featured speaker.
Americans for Prosperity has held at least eighty events targeting cap-and-trade legislation, which is aimed at making
industries pay for the air pollution that they create. Speakers for the group claimed, with exaggeration, that even back-yard
barbecues and kitchen stoves would be taxed. The group was also involved in the attacks on Obama's ""green jobs"" czar, Van
Jones, and waged a crusade against international climate talks. Casting, his group as a champion of ordinary workers who would
be hurt by environmentalists, Phillips went to Copenhagen last year and staged a protest outside the United Nations conference
on climate change, declaring, ""We're a grassroots organization.... 1 think it's unfortunate when wealthy children of wealthy
families . want to send unemployment rates in the United States up to twenty per cent.""
Grover Norquist, who holds a weekly meeting for conservative leaders in Washington, including representatives from
Americans for Prosperity, told me that last summer's raucous rallies were pivotal in undermining Obama's agenda. The
Republican leadership in Congress, he said, ""couldn't have clone it without August, when people went out on the streets. It
discouraged deal-makers""—Republicans who might otherwise have worked constructively with Obama. Moreover, the
appearance of growing public opposition to Obama affected corporate donors on K Street. ""K Street is a three-billion-dollar
weathervane,"" Norquist said. ""When Obama was strong, the Chamber of Commerce said, 'We can work with the Obama
Administration.' But that changed when thousands of people went into the street and 'terrorized' congressmen. August is what
changed it. Now that Obama is weak, people are getting tough.""
As the first anniversary of Obama's election approached, David Koch came to the Washington area to attend a triumphant
Americans for Prosperity gathering. Obama's poll numbers were falling fast. Not .a single Republican senator was working with
the Administration on health care, or much else. Pundits were writing about Obama's political ineptitude, and Tea Party groups
were accusing the President of initiating ""a government takeover."" In a speech, Koch said, ""Days like today bring to reality the
vision of our board of directors when we started this organization, five years ago."" He went on, ""We envisioned a mass
movement, a state-based one, but national in scope, of hundreds of thousands of American citizens from all walks of life
standing up and fighting for the economic freedoms that made our nation the most prosperous society in history.... Thankfully,
the stirrings from California to Virginia, and from Texas to Michigan, show that more and more of our fellow-citizens are
beginning to see the same truths as we do."" .
While Koch didn't explicitly embrace the Tea Party movement that day, more recently he has come close to doing so,
praising it for demonstrating the ""powerful visceral hostility in the body politic against the massive increase in government
power, the massive efforts to socialize this country."" Charles Koch, in a newsletter sent to his seventy thousand employees,
compared the Obama Administration to the regime of the Venezuelan strongman Hugo Chavez. The Kochs' sense of
imperilment is somewhat puzzling. Income inequality in America is greater than it has been since the nineteen-twenties, and
since the seventies the tax rates of the wealthiest have fallen more than those of the middle class. Yet the brothers' message has
evidently resonated with voters: a recent poll found that fifty-five per cent of Americans agreed that Obama is a socialist.
Americans for Prosperity, meanwhile, has announced that it will spend an additional forty-five million dollars before the
midterm elections, in November. Although the group is legally prohibited from directly endorsing candidates, it nonetheless
plans to target some fifty House races and half a dozen Senate races, staging rallies, organizing door-to-door canvassing, and
running ads aimed at ""educating voters about where candidates stand.""
Though the Kochs have slowed Obama's momentum, their larger political battle is far from won. Richard Fink, interviewed
by FrumForum.com this spring, said, ""If you look at where we've gone from the year 2000 to now, with the expansion of
government spending and a debt burden that threatens to bankrupt the country, it doesn't look very good at all."" He went on, ""It
looks like the infrastructure that was built and ruirtitred has not carried the day."" He suggested that the Kochs needed ""to get
more into the practical, day-to-day issues of governing.""
n 1991, David Koch was badly injured in a plane crash.in Los Angeles. He was the sole passenger in first class to survive. As he
was recovering, a routine physical exam led to the discovery of prostate cancer. Koch received treatment, settled down, started a
family, and reconsidered his life. As he told Portfolio, ""When you're the only one who survived in the front of the plane and
everyone.else died—yeah, you think, 'My God, the good Lord spared me for some greater purpose.' My joke is that I've been
busy ever since, doing all the good work 1 can think of, so He can have confidence in me.""
Koch began giving spectacularly large donations to the arts and sciences. And he became a patron of cancer research,
focussing on prostate cancer. In addition to his gifts to Sloan-Kettering, he gave fifteen million dollars to New York-
Presbyterian Hospital, a hundred and twenty-five million to M.I.T. for cancer research, twenty million to Johns Hopkins
University, and twenty-five million to the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, in Houston. In response to his generosity, Sloan-
Kettering gave Koch its Excellence in Corporate Leadership Award. In 2004, President Bush named him to the National Cancer
Advisory Board, which guides the National.Cancer Institute.
Koch's corporate and political roles, however, may pose conflicts of interest. For example, at the same time that David
Koch has been casting himself as a champion in the fight against cancer, Koch Industries has been lobbying to prevent the
E.P.A. from classifying formaldehyde, which the company produces in great quantities, as a ""known carcinogen"" in humans.
Scientists have long known that formaldehyde causes cancer in rats, and several major scientific studies have concluded
that formaldehyde causes cancer in human beings—including one published last year by the National Cancer Institute, on
•whose advisory board Koch sits. The study tracked twenty-five thousand patients for an average of forty years; subjects exposed
to higher amounts of formaldehyde had significantly higher rates of leukemia. These results helped lead an expert panel within
the National Institutes of Health to conclude that formaldehyde should be categorized as a known carcinogen, and be strictly
controlled by the government. Corporations have resisted regulations on formaldehyde for decades, however, and Koch
Industries has been a large funder of members of Congress who have stymied the E.P.A., requiring it to defer new regulations
until more studies are completed.
Koch Industries became a major producer of the chemical in 2005, after it bought Georgia-Pacific, the paper and wood-
products company, for twenty-one billion dollars. Georgia-Pacific manufactures formaldehyde in its chemical division, and uses
it to produce various wood products, such as plywood and laminates. Its annual production capacity for formaldehyde is 2.2
billion pounds. Last December, Traylor Champion, Georgia-Pacific's vice-president of environmental affairs, sent a formal
letter of protest to federal health authorities. He wrote that the company ""strongly disagrees"" with the N.I.H. panel's conclusion
that formaldehyde should be treated as a known human carcinogen. David Koch did not recuse himself from the National
Cancer Advisory Board, or divest himself of company stock, while his company was directly lobbying the government to keep
formaldehyde on the market. (A board spokesperson said that the issue of formaldehyde had not come up.)
James Fluff, an associate director at the National Institute for Environmental Health Sciences, a division of the N.I.H., told
me that it was ""disgusting"" for Koch to be serving on the National Cancer Advisory Board: ""It's just not good for public health.
Vested interests should not be on the board."" He 'went on, ""Those boards are very important. They're very influential as to
whether N.C.I. goes into formaldehyde or not. Billions of dollars are involved in formaldehyde.""
Harold Vannus, the director of the National Cancer Institute, knows David Koch from Memorial Sloan-Kettering, which he
used to run. He said that, at Sloan-Kettering, ""a lot of people who gave to us had large business interests. The one thing we
wouldn't tolerate in our board members is tobacco."" When told of Koch Industries' stance on formaldehyde, Varmus said that
he was ""surprised.""
he David H. Koch Hall of Human Origins, at the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History, is a multimedia
exploration of the theory that mankind evolved in response to climate change. At the main entrance, viewers are confronted
with a giant graph charting the Earth's temperature over the past ten million years, which notes that it is far cooler now than it
was ten thousand years ago. Overhead, the text reads, ""HUMANS EVOLVED IN RESPONSE TO A CHANGING WORLD."" The
message, as amplified by the exhibit's Web site, is that ""key human adaptations evolved in response to
environmental instability."" Only at the end of the exhibit, under the headline ""OUR SURVIVAL CHALLENGE,"" is it noted
that levels of carbon dioxide are higher now than they have ever been, and that they are projected to increase
dramatically in the next century. No cause is given for this development; no mention is made of any possible role
played by fossil fuels. The exhibit makes it seem part of a natural continuum. The accompanying text says, ""During
the period in which humans evolved, Earth's temperature and the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere
fluctuated together."" An interactive game in the exhibit suggests that humans will continue to adapt to climate
change in the future. People may build ""underground cities;"" developing ""short, compact bodies"" or ""curved spines,""
so that ""moving around in tight spaces will be no problem.""
Such ideas uncannily echo the Koch message. The company's January newsletter to employees, for instance, argueS that
""fluctuations in the earth's climate predate humanity,"" and concludes, ""Since we can't control Mother Nature, let's figure out
how to get along with her changes."" Joseph Romm, a physicist who runs the Web site ClirnateProgress.org, is infuriated by the
Smithsonian's presentation. ""The whole exhibit whitewashes the modern climate issue,"" he said. ""I think the Kochs wanted to
be seen as some sort of high-minded company, associated with the greatest natural-history and science museum in the country.
But the truth is, the exhibit is underwritten by big-time polluters, who are underground .funders of action to stop efforts to deal
with this threat to humanity. I think the Smithsonian should have drawn the line.""
Cristian Samper, the museum's director, said that the exhibit is not about climate change, and described Koch as ""one of the
best donors we've had, in my tenure here, because he's very interested in the content, but completely hands off."" He noted, ""1.
don't know all the details.of his involvement in other issues.""
The Kochs have long depended on the public's not knowing all the details about them. They have been content to operate what
David Koch has called ""the largest company that you've never heard of."" But with the growing prominence of the Tea Party,
and with increased awareness of the Kochs' ties to the movement, the brothers may find it harder to deflect scrutiny. Recently,
President °barna took aim at the Kochs' political network. Speaking at a Democratic National Committee fund-raiser, in
Austin, he warned supporters that the Supreme Court's recent ruling in the Citizens United case—which struck down laws
prohibiting direct Corporate spending on campaigns—had made it even easier for big companies to hide behind ""groups with
harmless-sounding names like Americans for Prosperity."" Obama said, ""They don't have to say who, exactly, Americans for
Prosperity are. You don't know if it's a foreign-controlled corporation""—or even, he added, ""a big oil company.""","UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05771774 Date: 08/31/2015

A REPORTER AT 1.ARGE
COVERT OPERATIONS
The billionaire brothers who are waging a war against Obama.
by Jane Mayetmo,
(.s..
David H. Koch in 1996. He and his brother Charles are lifelong libertarians and have quietly given more than a hundred million
dollars to right-wing causes.
On May 17th, a black-tie audience at the Metropolitan Opera House applauded as a tall, jovial-looking billionaire tOok the
stage. It was the seventieth annual spring gala of American Ballet Theatre, and David H. Koch was being celebrated for his
generosity as a member of the board of trustees; he had recently donated $2.5 million toward the company's upcoming season,
and had given many millions before that. Koch received an award while flanked by two of the gala's co-chairs, Blaine Trump,
in a peach-colored gown, and Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg, in emerald green. Kennedy's mother, Jacqueline Kennedy
Onassis, had been a patron of the ballet and, coincidentally, the previous owner of a Fifth Avenue apartment that Koch had
bought, in 1995, and then sold, eleven years later, for thirty-two million dollars, having found it too small.
The gala marked the social ascent of Koch, who, at the age of seventy, has become one of the city's most prominent
philanthropists. In 2008, he donated a hundred million dollars to modernize. Lincoln Center's New York State Theatre building,
which now bears his name. He has given twenty million to the American Museum of Natural History, whose dinosaur wing is
named for him. This spring, after noticing the decrepit state of the fountains outside the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Koch
pledged at least ten million dollars for their renovation. He is a trustee of the museum, perhaps the most coveted social prize in

the city, and serves on the board of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, where, after he donated more than forty million
dollars, an endowed chair and a research center were named for him.
One dignitary was conspicuously absent from the gala: the event's third honorary co-chair, Michelle Obama. Her office
said that a scheduling conflict had prevented her from attending. Yet had the First Lady shared the stage with Koch it might
have created an awkward tableau. In Washington, Koch is best known as part of a family that has repeatedly funded stealth
attacks on the federal government, and on the Obama Administration in particular.
With his brother Charles, who is seventy-four, David Koch owns virtually all of Koch Industries, a conglomerate,
headquartered in Wichita. Kansas, whose annual revenues are estimated to be a hundred billion dollars. The company has
grown spectacularly since their father, Fred, died, in 1967, and the brothers took charge. The Kochs operate oil refineries in
Alaska, Texas, and Minnesota, and control some four thousand miles of pipeline. Koch Industries owns Brawny paper towels,
Dixie. cups, Georgia-Pacific lumber, Staimnaster carpet, and Lycra, among other products. Forbes ranks it as the second-largest
private company in the country, after Cargill, and its consistent profitability has made David and Charles Koch—who, years
ago, bought out two other brothers—among the richest Men in America. Their combined fortune of thirty-five billion dollars is
exceeded only by those of Bill Gates and Warren Buffett.
The Kochs are longtime libertarians who believe in drastically lower personal and corporate taxes, minimal social services
for the needy, and much less oversight of industry—especially environmental regulation. These views dovetail with the
brothers' corporate interests. In a study released this spring, the University of Massachusetts at Amherst's Political Economy
Research Institute named Koch Industries one of the top ten air polluters in the United States.- And Greenpeace issued a report
identifying the company as a ""kingpin of climate science denial."" The report showed that, from 2005 to 2008, the Kochs vastly
outdid ExxonMobil in giving money to organizations fighting legislation related to climate change, unclerwriting'a huge
network of foundations, think tanks, and political front groups. Indeed, the brothers have funded opposition campaigns against
so many Obama Administration policies—from health-care reform to the economic-stimulus program----that, in political circles,
their ideological network is known as the Kochtopus.
In a statement, Koch Industries said that the Greenpeace report ""distorts the environmental record of our companies."" And. .
David Koch, in a recent, admiring article about him in New York, protested that the ""radical press"" had turned his family into
""whipping boys,"" and had exaggerated its influence on American politics. But Charles Lewis, the founder of the Center for
Public Integrity, a nonpartisan watchdog group, said, ""The Kochs are on a whole different level. There's no one else who has
spent this much money. The sheer dimension of it is what sets them apart. They have a pattern of lawbreaking, political
manipulation, and obfuscation. I've been in Washington since Watergate, and I've never seen anything like it. They are the
Standard Oil of our times.""
few weeks after the Lincoln Center gala, the advocacy wing of the Americans for Prosperity Foundation—an organization that
David Koch started, in 2004—held a different kind of gathering. Over the July 4th weekend, a summit called Texas Defending
the American Dream took place in a chilly hotel ballroom in Austin. Though Koch freely promotes his philanthropic ventures,
lie did not attend the summit, and his name was not in evidence. And on this occasion the audience was roused not by a,dance
performance but by a series of speakers denouncing President Barack Obama. Peggy Venable, the organizer of the summit,
warned that Administration officials ""have a socialist visiOn for this country.""
Five hundred people attended the summit, which served, in part, as a training session for Tea Party activists in Texas. An
advertisement cast the event as a populist uprising against vested corporate power. ""Today, the voices of average Americans are
being drowned out by lobbyists and special interests,"" it said. ""But you can do something about it."" The pitch made no mention
of its corporate funders. The White House has expressed frustration that such sponsors have largely eluded public notice. David .
Axelrod, Obama's senior adviser, said, ""What they don't say is that, in part, this is a grassroots citizens' movement brought to
you by a bunch of oil billionaires.""
In April, 2009, Melissa Cohlmia, a company spokesperson; denied that the Kochs had direct links to the Tea Party, saying
that Americans for Prosperity is ""an independent organization and Koch companies do not in any way direct their activities.""
.Later, she issued a statement: ""No funding has been provided by Koch companies, the Koch foundations, or Charles Koch or
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05771774 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05771774 Date: 08/31/2015
David Koch specifically to support the tea parties."" David Koch told New York, ""I've never been to a tea-party event. No one
representing the tea party has ever even approached me.""
At the lectern in Austin, however, Venable—a longtime political operative who draws a salary from Americans for
Prosperity, and who has worked for Koch-funded political groups since 1994—spoke less warily: ""We love what the Tea
Parties are doing, because that's how we're going to take back America!"" she declared, as the crowd cheered. In a subsequent
interview, she described herself as an early member of the movement, joking, ""I was part of the Tea Party before it was cool!""
She explained that the role of Americans for Prosperity was to help ""educate"" Tea Party activists on policy details, and to give
them ""next-step training"" after their rallies, so that their political energy could be channelled ""more effectively."" And she noted
that Americans for Prosperity had provided Tea Party activists with lists of elected officials to target. She said of the Kochs.
""They're certainly our people. David's the chairman of our board. I've certainly met with them, and I'm very appreciative Of
what they do.""
Venable honored several Tea Party ""citizen leaders"" at the summit. The Texas branch of Americans for Prosperity gave its
Blogger of the Year Award to a young woman named Sibyl West. On June 14th, West, writing on her site, described Obama as
the ""cokehead in chief."" In an online thread, West speculated that the President was exhibiting symptoms of ""demonic
possession (aka schizophrenia, etc.)."" The summit featured several paid speakers, including Janine Turner, the actress best
known for her role on the television series ""Northern Exposure."" She declared, ""They don't want our children to know about
their rights. They don't want our children to know about a God!""
During a catered lunch, Venable introduced Ted Cruz, a former solicitor general of Texas, who told the crowd that Obama
was ""the most radical President ever to occupy the Oval Office,"" and had hidden from voters a secret agenda—""the government
taking over our economy and our lives."" Countering Obama, Cruz proclaimed, was the epic fight of our generation!"" As the
crowd rose to its feet and cheered, he quoted the defiant words of a Texan at the Alamo: ""Victory, or death!""
Americans for Prosperity has worked closely with the Tea Party since the movement's inception. In the weeks before the
first Tax Day protests, in April, 2009, Americans for Prosperity hosted a Web site offering supporters ""Tea Party Talking
Points."" The Arizona branch urged people to send tea bags to Obama; the Missouri branch urged members to sign up for
""Taxpayer Tea Party Registration"" and provided directions to nine protests. The group continues to stoke the rebellion. The
North Carolina branch recently launched a ""Tea Party Finder"" Web site, advertised as ""a hub for all the Tea Parties in North
Carolina.""
The anti-government fervor infusing the 2010 elections represents a political triumph for the Kochs. By giving money to
""educate,"" fund, and organize Tea Party protesters, they have helped turn their private agenda into a mass movement. Bruce
Bartlett, a conservative economist and a historian, who once worked at the National Center for Policy Analysis, a Dallas-based
think tank that the Kochs fund, said, ""The problem with the whole libertarian movement is that it's been all chiefs and no
Indians. There haven't been any actual people, like voters, who give a crap about it. So the problem for the Kochs has been
trying to create a movement."" With the emergence of the Tea Party, he said, ""everyone suddenly sees that for the first time there
are Indians out there—people who can provide real ideological power."" The Kochs, he said, are ""trying to shape and control and
channel the populist uprising into their own policies.""-
A Republican campaign consultant who has done research on behalf of Charles and David Koch said of the Tea Party, ""The
Koch brothers gave the money that founded it. It's like they put the seeds in the ground. Then the rainstorm comes, and the
frogs come out of the mud—and they're our candidates!""
The Kochs and their political operatives declined requests for interviews. Instead, a prominent New York public-relations
executive who is close with the Kochs put forward two friends: George Pataki, the former governor of New York, and Mortimer
Zuckerman, the publisher and real-estate magnate. Pataki, a Republican who received campaign donations from David Koch,
called him ""a patriot who cares deeply about his country."" Zuckerman praised David's ""gentle decency"" and the ""range of his
public interests.""
The Republican campaign consultant said of the family's political activities, ""To call them under the radar is an
understatement. They are underground!"" Another former Koch adviser said, ""They're smart. This right-wing, redneck stuff
works for them. They see this as a way to get things done without getting dirty themselves."" Rob Stein, a Democratic political

strategist who has studied the conservative movement's finances, said that the Kochs are ""at the epicenter of the anti-Obama
movement. But it's not just about Obama. They would have done the same to Hillary Clinton. They did the same with Bill •
Clinton. They are out to destroy progressivism.""
ddly enough, the fiercely capitalist Koch family owes part of its fortune to Joseph Stalin. Fred Koch was the son of a Dutch
printer who settled in Texas and ran a weekly newspaper. Fred attended M.I.T., where he earned a degree in chemical
engineering. In 1927, he invented a more efficient process for converting oil into gasoline; but, according to family lore,
America's major oil companies regarded him as a threat and shut him out of the industry. Unable to succeed at home, Koch
found work in the Soviet Union. In the nineteen-thirties, his company trained Bolshevik engineers and helped Stalin's regime
set up fifteen modern oil refineries. Over time, however, Stalin brutally purged several of Koch's Soviet colleagues. Koch was
deeply affected by the experience, and regretted his collaboration. He returned to the U.S. In the headquarters of his company,
Rock Island Oil & Refining, in Wichita, he kept photographs aimed at proving that some of those Soviet refineries had been
destroyed in the Second World War. Gus diZerega, a former friend of Charles Koch, recalled, ""As the Soviets became a
stronger military power, Fred felt a certain amount of guilt at having helped build them up. I think it bothered him a lot.""
In 1958, Fred Koch became one of the original members of the john Birch Society, the arch-conservative group known, in
part, for a highly skeptical view of governance and for spreading fears of a Communist takeover. Members considered President
Dwight D. Eisenhower to be a Communist agent. In a self-published broadside, Koch claimed that the Communists have
infiltrated both the Democrat and Republican Parties."" He wrote admiringly of Benito Mussolini's suppression of Communists
in Italy, and disparagingly of the American civil-rights movement. ""The colored man looms large in the Communist plan to take
over America,"" he warned. Welfare was a secret plot to attract rural blacks to cities, where they would foment ""a vicious race
war."" In a 1963 speech that prefigures the Tea Party's talk of a secret 'socialist plot, Koch predicted that Communists would
""infiltrate the highest offices of government in the U.S. until the President is a Communist, unknown to the rest of us.""
Koch married Mary Robinson, the daughter of a Missouri physician, and they had four sons: Freddie, Charles, and twins,
David and William. John Damgard, the president of the Futures Industry Association, was David's schoolmate and friend. He
recalled that Fred Koch was ""a real John Wayne type."" Koch emphasized rugged pursuits, taking his sons big-game hunting in
Africa, and requiring them to do farm labor at the family ranch. The Kochs lived in a stone mansion on a large compound across
from Wichita's country club; in the summer, the boys could hear their friends splashing in the pool, but they were not allowed
to join them. ""By instilling a work ethie in me at an early age, my father did me a big favor, although it didn't seem like a favor
back then,"" Charles has written. ""By the time I was eight, he made sure work occupied most of my spare time."" David Koch
recalled that his father also indoctrinated the boys politically. ""He was constantly speaking to us children about what was wrong
with government,"" he told Brian Doherty, an editor of the libertarian magazine Reason, and the author of ""Radicals for
Capitalism,"" a 2007 history of the libertarian movement. ""It's something I grew up with—a fundamental point of view that big
government was bad, and imposition of government controls on our lives and economic fortunes was not good.""
David attended Deerfield Academy, in Massachusetts, and Charles was sent to military school. Charles, David, and William
all earned engineering degrees at their father's alma mater, M.I.T., and later joined the family company. Charles eventually
assumed control, with David as his deputy; William's career at the company was less successful. Freddie went to Harvard and
studied playwriting at the Yale School of Drama. His father reportedly disapproved of him, and punished him financially.
(Freddie, through a spokesperson, denied this:)
In 1967, after Fred Koch died, of a heart attack, Charles renamed the business Koch Industries, in honor of his father. Fred
Koch's will made his sons extraordinarily wealthy. David Koch joked about his good fortune in a 2003 speech to alumni at
Deerfield, where, after pledging twenty-five million dollars, he was made the school's sole ""lifetime trustee."" He said, ""You
might ask: How does David Koch happen to have the wealth to be so generous? Well, let me tell you a story. It all started when
I was alittle boy. One day, my father gave me an apple. I soon sold it for five dollars and bought two apples and sold them for
ten. Then I bought four apples and sold them for twenty. Well, this went on day after day, week after week, month after month,
year after year, until my father died and left me three hundred million dollars!""
David and Charles had absorbed their father's conservative politics, but they did not share all his views, according to
diZerega, who befriended Charles in the mid-sixties, after meeting him while browsing in a John Birch Society bookstore in

Wichita. Charles eventually invited him to the Kochs' mansion, to participate in an informal political-discussion group. ""It was
pretty clear that Charles thought some of the Birch Society was bullshit,"" diZerega recalled.
DiZerega, who has lost touch with Charles, eventually abandOned right-wing views, and became a political-science
professor. He credits Charles with opening his mind to political philosophy, which set him on the path to academia; Charles is
one of three people to whom he dedicated his first book. But diZerega believes that the Koch brothers have followed a wayward
intellectual trajectory, transferring their father's paranoia about Soviet Communism to a distrust of the U.S. government, and
seeing its expansion, beginning with the New Deal, as a tyrannical threat to freedom. In an essay, posted on Beliefnet, diZerega
writes, ""As state socialism failed ... the target for many within these organizations shifted to any kind of regulation at all.
'Socialism' kept. being defined downwards.""
Members of the. John Birch Society developed.an interest in a school of Austrian economists who promoted free-market
ideals. Charles and David Koch were particularly influenced by the work of Friedrich von Hayek, the author of ""The Road to
Serfdom"" (1944), which argued that centralized government planning led, inexorably, to totalitarianism. Hayek'S belief in
unfettered capitalism has proved inspirational to many conservatives, and to anti-Soviet dissidents; lately, Tea Party supporters
have championed his work. In June, the talk-radio host Glenn Beck, who has supported the Tea Party rebellion, promoted ""The
Road to Serfdom"" on his show; the paperback soon became a No. 1 best-seller on Amazon. (Beck appears to be a fan of the
Kochs; in the midst of arecent on-air parody of Al Gore, Beck said, without explanation, ""I want to thank Charles Koch for this
information."" Beck declined to elaborate on the relationship.)
Charles and David also became devotees of a more radical thinker, Robert LeFevre, who favored the abolition of the state
but didn't like the label ""anarchist""; he called himself an ""autarchist."" LeFevre liked to say that ""government is a disease
masquerading as its own cure."" In 1956, he opened an institution called the Freedom School, in Colorado Springs. Brian
Doherty, of Reason, told me that ""LeFevre was an anarchist figure who won Charles's heart,"" and that the school was ""a tiny
world of people who thought the New Deal was a horrible mistake."" According to diZerega, Charles supported the school
financially, and even gave him money to take classes there.
Throughout the seventies, Charles and David continued to build Koch Industries. In 1980, William, with assistance from
Freddie, attempted to take over the company from Charles, who, they felt, had assumed autocratic control. In retaliation, the
company's board, which answered to Charles, fired William. (""Charles runs it all with an iron hand,"" Bruce Bartlett, the
economist, told me.) Lawsuits were filed, with William and Freddie on one side and Charles and David on the other. In 1983,
Charles and David bought out their brothers' share in the company for nearly a billion dollars. But the antagonism remained,
and litigation continued for seventeen more years, with the brothers hiring rival private investigators; in 1990, they walked past
one another with stony expressions at their mother's funeral. Eventually. Freddie moved to Monaco, which has no income tax.
He bought historic, estates in France. Austria, and elsewhere, filling them with art, antiques, opera scores, and literary
manuscripts. William founded his own energy company, Oxbow, and turned to yachting; he spent an estimated sixty-five
million dollars to win the America's Cup, in 1992.
With Charles as the undisputed chairman and C.E.O., Koch Industries expanded rapidly. Roger Altman, who heads the
investment-banking firm Evercore, told me that the company's performance has been ""beyond phenomenal."" Charles remained
in Wichita, with his wife and two children, guarding his privacy while supporting community charities. David moved to New
York City, where he is an executive vice-president of the company and the C.E.O. of its Chemical Technology Group. A
financial expert who knows Koch Industries well told me, ""Charles is the company. Charles runs it."" David, described by
associates as ""affable"" and ""a bit of a lunk,"" enjoyed for years the life of a wealthy bachelor. He rented a yacht in the South of
France and bought a waterfront home in Southampton, where he threw parties that the Web site New York Social Diary likened
to an ""East Coast version of Hugh Hefher's soirees."" In 1996, he married Julia Flesher, a fashion assistant. They live in a nine-
thousand-square-foot duplex at 740 Park Avenue, with their three children. Though David's manner is more cosmopolitan, and
more genial, than that of Charles, Brian Doherty, who has interviewed both brothers, couldn't think of a single issue on which
the brothers disagreed.
As their fortunes grew, Charles and David Koch became the primary underwriters of hard-line libertarian politics in
America. Charles's goal, as Doherty described it, was to tear the government ""out at the root."" The brothers' first major public
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05771774 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05771774 Date: 08/31/2015
step came in 1979, when Charles persuaded David, then thirty-nine, to run for public office. They had become supporters of the
Libertarian Party, and were backing its Presidential candidate, Ed Clark, who was running against Ronald Reagan from the
right. Frustrated by the legal limits on campaign donations, they contrived to place David on the ticket, in the Vice-Presidential
slot; upon becoming a candidate, he could lavish as much of his personal fortune as he wished on the campaign. The ticket's
slogan was ""The Libertarian Party has only one source of funds: You."" In fact, its primary source of funds was David Koch,
who spent more than two million dollars on the effort.
Many of the ideas propounded in the 1980 campaign presaged the Tea Party movement. Ed Clark told The Nation that
libertarians were getting ready to stage ""a very big tea party,"" because people were ""sick to death"" of taxes. The Libertarian
Party platform called for the abolition of the F.B.I. and the C.I.A., as well as of federal regulatory agencies, such as the
Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Energy. The Party wanted to end Social Security, minimum-wage
laws, gun control, and all personal and corporate income taxes; it proposed the legalization of prostitution, recreational drugs,
and suicide. Government should be reduced to only one function: the protection of individual rights. William F. Buckley, Jr., a
more traditional conservative, called the movement ""Anarcho-Totalitarianism.""
That November, the Libertarian ticket received only one per cent of the vote. The brothers realized that their brand of
politics didn't sell at the ballot box. Charles Koch became openly scornful of conventional politics. ""It tends to be a nasty,
corrupting business,"" he told a reporter at the time. ""I'm interested in advancing libertarian ideas."" According to Doherty's
book, the .Kochs came to regard elected politicians as merely ""actors playing out a script."" A longtime confidant of the Kochs
told Doherty that the brothers wanted to ""supply the themes and words for the scripts."" In order to alter the direction of
America, they had to ""influence the areas where policy ideas percolate from: academia. and think tanks.""
fter the 1980 election, Charles and David Koch receded from the public arena. But they poured more than a hundred million
. dollars into dozens of seemingly independent organizations. Tax records indicate that in 2008 the three main Koch family
foundations gave money.to thirty-four political and policy organizations, three of which they founded, and several of which
they direct. The Kochs and their company have given additional millions to political campaigns, advocacy groups, and
lobbyists. The family's subterranean financial role has fuelled suspicion on the left: Lee Fang, of the liberal blog ThinkProgress,
has called the Kochs the billionaires behind the hate.""
Only the Kochs know precisely how much they have spent on politics. Public tax records show that between 1998 and 2008
the Charles G. Koch Charitable Foundation spent more than forty-eight million dollars. The Claude R. Lambe Charitable
Foundation, which is controlled by Charles Koch and his wife, along with two company employees and an accountant, spent
more than twenty-eight million. The David H. Koch Charitable Foundation spent more than a hundred and twenty million.
Meanwhile, since 1998 Koch Industries has spent more than fifty million dollars on lobbying. Separately, the company's
political-action committee, KochPAC, has donated some eight million dollars to political campaigns, more than eighty
per cent of it to Republicans. So far in 2010, Koch Industries leads all other energy companies in political
contributions, as it has since 2006. In addition, during the past dozen years the Kochs and other family members
have personally spent more than two million dollars on political contributions. In the second quarter of 2010, David
Koch was the biggest individual contributor to the Republican Governors Association, with a million-dollar donation.
Other gifts by the Kochs may be untraceable; federal tax law permits anonymous personal donations to politically
active nonprofit groups.
In recent decades, members of several industrial dynasties have spent parts of their fortunes on a conservative agenda. In
the nineteen-eighties, the Olin family, which owns a chemicals-and-manufacturing conglomerate, became known for funding
right-leaning thinking in academia, particularly in law schools. And during the nineties Richard Mellon Scaife, a descendant of
Andrew Mellon, spent millions attempting to discredit President Bill Clinton. An Rabin-Havt, a vice-president at the
Democratic-leaning Web site Media Matters, said that the Kochs' effort is Unusual, in its marshalling of corporate and personal
funds: ""Their role, in terms of financial commitments, is staggering.""
Of course, Democrats give money, too. Their most prominent donor, the financier George Soros, runs a foundation, the
Open Society Institute, that has spent as much as a hundred million dollars a year in America. Soros has also made generous
private contributions to various Democratic campaigns, including Obama's. But Michael Vachon, his spokesman, argued that
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05771774 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05771774 Date: 08/31/2015
Soros's giving is transparent, and that ""none of his contributions are in the service of his own economic interests."" The Kochs
have given millions of dollars to nonprofit groups that criticize environmental regulation and support lower taxes for industry.
Gus diZerega, the former friend, suggested that the Kochs' youthful idealism about libertarianism had largely devolved into a
rationale for corporate self-interest. He said of Charles, ""Perhaps he has confused making money with freedom.""
Some critics have suggested that the Kochs' approach has subverted the purpose of tax-exempt giving. By law, charitable
foundations must conduct exclusively nonpartisan activities that promote the public welfare. A 2004 report by the National
Committee for Responsive Philanthropy, a watchdog group, described the Kochs' foundations as being self-serving,
concluding, ""These foundations give money to nonprofit organizations that do research and advocacy on issues that impact the
profit margin of Koch Industries.""
The Kochs have gone well beyond their immediate self-interest, however, funding organizations that aim to push the
country in a libertarian. direction. Among the institutions that they have subsidized are the Institute for Justice, which files.
lawsuits opposing state and federal regulations; the Institute for Humane Studies, which underwrites libertarian academics; and
the Bill of Rights Institute, which promotes a conservative slant on the Constitution. Many of the organizations funded by the
Kochs employ specialists who write position Papers that are subsequently quoted by politicians and pundits. David Koch has
acknowledged that the family exerts tight ideological control. ""If we're going to give a lot of money, we'll make darn sure they •
spend it in a way that goes along with our intent,"" he told Doherty. ""And if they make a wrong turn and start doing things we
don't agree with, we withdraw funding.""
he Kochs' subsidization of a pro-corporate movement fulfills, in many ways, the vision laid out in a secret 1971 memo that
Lewis Powell. then a Virginia attorney, wrote two months before he was nominated to the Supreme Court. The antiwar
movement had turned its anger on defense contractors, such as Dow Chemical, and Ralph Nader was leading a public-interest
crusade against corporations. Powell, writing a report for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, urged American companies to fight
back. The greatest threat to free enterprise, he warned, was not Communism or the New Left but, rather, ""respectable elements
of society""—intellectuals, journalists, and scientists. To defeat them, he wrote, business leaders needed to wage a long-term,
• unified campaign to change public opinion.
Charles Koch seems to have approached both business and politics with the deliberation of an engineer. ""To bring about
social change,"" he told Doherty, requires ""a strategy"" that is ""vertically and horizontally integrated,"" spanning ""from idea
creation to policy development to education to grassroots organizations to lobbying to litigation to political action."" The project,
he admitted, was extremely ambitious. ""We have a radical philosophy,"" he said.
In 1977, the Kochs provided the funds to launch the nation's first libertarian think tank, the Cato Institute. According to the
'Center for Public Integrity, between 1986 and 1993 the Koch family gave eleven million dollars to the institute. Today Cato
has more than a hundred full-time employees, and its experts and policy papers are widely quoted and respected by the
mainstream media. It describes itself as nonpartisan, and its scholars have at times been critical of both parties. But it has
consistently pushed for corporate tax cuts, reductions in social services, and laissez-faire environmental policies.
When President Obama, in a 2008 speech, described the science on global warming as ""beyond dispute,"" the Cato Institute
took out a full-page ad in the Times to contradict him. Cato's resident scholars have relentlessly criticized political attempts to
stop global warming as expensive, ineffective, and unnecessary. Ed Crane, the Cato Institute's founder and president, told me
that ""global-warming theories give the government more control of the economy.""
Cato scholars have been particularly energetic in promoting the Climategate scandal. Last year, private e-mails of climate
scientists at the University of East Anglia, in England, were mysteriously leaked, and their exchanges appeared to suggest a
willingness to falsify data in order to buttress the idea that global warming is real. In the two weeks after the e-mails went
public, one Cato scholar gave more than twenty media interviews trumpeting the alleged scandal. But five independent inquiries
have since exonerated the researchers, and nothing was found in their e-mails or data to discredit the scientific consensus on
global warming. •
Nevertheless, the controversy succeeded in spreading skepticism about climate change. Even though the National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration recently issued a report concluding that the evidence for global warming is unequivocal, more
Americans are convinced than at any time since 1997 that scientists have exaggerated the seriousness of global warming. The

Kochs promote this statistic on their company's Web site but do not mention the role that their funding has played in fostering
such doubt.
In a 2002 memo, the Republican political consultant Frank Luntz wrote that so long as ""voters believe there is no consensus
about global warming within the scientific community' the status quo would prevail. The key for opponents of environmental
reform, he said, was to question the science—a public-relations strategy that the tobacco industry used effectively for years to
forestall regulation. The Kochs have funded many sources of environmental skepticism, such as the Heritage Foundation, which
has argued that ""scientific facts gathered in the past 10 years do not support the notion of catastrophic human-made warming.""
The brothers have given money to more obscure groups, too, such as the Independent Women's Forum, which opposes the
presentation of global warming as a scientific fact in American public schools. Until 2008, the group was run by Nancy
Pfotenhauer, a former lobbyist for Koch Industries. Mary Beth Jarvis, a vice-president of a Koch subsidiary, is on the group's
board.
Naomi Oreskes, a professor of history and science studies at the University of California, San Diego, is the co-author of
""Merchants of Doubt,"" a new book that chronicles various attempts by American industry to manipulate public opinion on
science. She noted that the Kochs, as the heads of ""a company with refineries and pipelines,"" have ""a lot at stake."" She added,
""If the answer is to phase out fossil fuels, a different group of people are going to be making money, so we shouldn't be
surprised that they're fighting tooth and nail.""
David Koch told New York that he was unconvinced that global warming has been caused by human activity. Even if it has
been, he said, the heating of the planet will be beneficial, resulting in longer growing seasons in the Northern Hemisphere. ""The
Earth will be able to support enormously more people because far greater land area will be available to produce food,"" he said.
n the mid-eighties, the Kochs provided millions of dollars to George Mason University, in Arlington, Virginia, to set up another
think tank. Now known as the Mercatus Center, it promotes itself as ""the world's premier university source for market-oriented
ideas—bridging the gap between academic ideas and real-world problems."" Financial records show that the Koch family
foundations have contributed more than thirty million dollar's to George Mason, much of which has gone to the Mercatus
Center, a nonprofit organization. ""It's ground zero for deregulation policy in Washington,"" Rob Stein, the Democratic strategist,
said. It is an unusual arrangement. ""George Mason is a public university, and receives public funds,"" Stein noted. ""Virginia is
hosting an institution that the Kochs practically control.""
The founder of the Mercatus Center is Richard Fink, formerly an economist. Fink heads Koch Industries' lobbying
operation in Washington. In addition, he is the president of the Charles G. Koch Charitable Foundation, the president of the
Claude R. Lambe Charitable Foundation, a director of the Fred C. and Mary R. Koch Foundation, and a director and co-
founder, with David Koch, of the Americans for Prosperity Foundation.
Fink, with his many titles, has become the central nervous system of the Kochtopus. He appears to have supplanted Ed
Crane, the head of the Cato Institute, as the brothers' main political lieutenant. Though David remains on the board at Cato,
Charles Koch has fallen out with Crane. Associates suggested to me that Crane had been insufficiently respectful of Charles's
management philosophy, which he distilled into a book called ""The Science of Success,"" and trademarked under the name
Market-Based Management, or M.B.M. In the book. Charles recommends instilling a company's corporate culture with the
competitiveness of the marketplace.. Koch describes M.B.M. as a ""holistic system"" containing ""five dimensions: vision, virtue
and talents, knowledge processes, decision rights and incentives."" A top Cato Institute official told me that Charles ""thinks he's
a genius. He's the emperor, and he's convinced he's wearing clothes."" Fink, by contrast, has been far more embracing of
Charles's ideas. (Fink, like the Kochs, declined to. be interviewed.)
At a 1995 conference for philanthropfsts, Fink adopted the language of economics when speaking about the Mercatus
Center's purpose. He said that grant-makers should use think tanks and political-action groups to convert intellectual raw
materials into policy ""products.""
The Wall Street Journal has called the Mercatus Center ""the most important think tank you've never heard of,"" and noted
that fourteen of the twenty-three regulations that President George W. Bush placed on a ""hit list"" had been suggested first by
Mercatus scholars. Fink told the paper that the Kochs have ""other means of fighting [their] battles,"" and that the Mercatus
Center does riot actively promote the company's private interests. But Thomas McGarity, a law professor at the University of
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05771774 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05771774 Date: 08/31/2015
Texas, who specializes in environmental issues, told me that ""Koch has been constantly in trouble with the E.P.A., and
Mercatus has constantly hammered on the agency."" An environmental lawyer who has clashed with the Mercatus Center called
it ""a means of laundering economic aims."" The lawyer explained the strategy: ""You take corporate money and give it to a
neutral-sounding think tank,"" which ""hires people with pedigrees and academic degrees who put out credible-seeming studies.
But they all coincide perfectly with the economic interests of their funders.""
In 1997, for instance, the E.P.A. moved to reduce surface ozone, a form of pollution caused, in part, by emissions from oil
refineries. Susan Dudley, an economist who became a top official at the 'Mercatus Center, criticized the proposed rule. The
E.P.A., she argued, had not taken into account that smog-free skies would result in more cases of skin cancer. She projected that
if pollution were controlled it would cause up to eleven thousand additional cases of skin cancer each year.
In 1999, the District of Columbia Circuit Court took 'up Dudley's smog argument. Evaluating the E.P.A. rule, the court
found that the E.P.A. had ""explicitly disregarded"" the ""possible health benefits of ozone."" In another part of the opinion, the
court ruled, 2-1, that the E.P.A. had overstepped its authority in calibrating standards for ozone emissions. As the Constitutional
Accountability Center, a think tank, revealed, the judges in the majority had previously attended legal junkets, on a Montana
ranch, that were arranged by the Foundation for Research on Economics and the Environment—a group funded by Koch family
foundations. The judges have claimed that the ruling was unaffected by their attendance.
deas don't happen on their own,"" Matt Kibbe, the president of Freedom Works, a Tea Party advocacy group, told me.
""Throughout history, ideas need patrons."" The Koch brothers, after helping to create Cato and Mercatus, concluded that think
tanks alone were not enough to effect change. They needed a mechanism to deliver those ideas to the street, and to attract the
public's support. in 1984, David Koch and Richard Fink created yet another organization. and Kibbe joined them. The group,
Citizens for a Sound Economy, seemed like a grassroots movement, but according to the Center for Public Integrity it was
sponsored principally by the Kochs, who provided $7.9 million between 1986 and 19.93. Its mission, Kibbe said, ""was to take
these heavy ideas and translate them for mass America.... We read the same literature Obama did about nonviolent
revolutions--Saul _Minsky, Gandhi, Martin Luther King. We studied the idea of the Boston Tea Party as an example of
nonviolent social change. We learned we needed boots on the ground to sell ideas, not candidates."" Within a few years, the
group had mobilized fifty paid field workers, in twenty-six states, to rally voters behind the Kochs' agenda. David and Charles,
according to one participant, were ""very controlling, very top down. You can't build an organization with them. They run it.""
Around this time, the brothers faced a political crisis. In 1989, the Senate Select Committee on Indian Affairs investigated
their business and released a scathing report accusing Koch Oil of ""a widespread and sophisticated scheme to steal crude oil
from Indians and others through fraudulent mismeasuring."" The Kochs admitted that they had improperly taken thirty-one
million dollars' worth of crude oil, but said that it had been accidental. Charles Koch told committee investigators that oil
measurement is ""a very uncertain art.""
To defend its reputation, Koch IndustrieS hired Robert Strauss, then a premier Washington lobbyist; the company soon
opened an office in the city. A grand jury was convened to investigate the allegations, but it eventually disbanded, without
issuing criminal charges. According to the Senate report, after the committee hearings Koch operatives delved into the personal
lives of committee staffers, even questioning an ex-wife. Senate investigators were upset by the Kochs' tactics. Kenneth Batten,
the counsel to the Senate committee, said, ""These people have amassed such unaccountable power!'
.'
By •1993, when Bill Clinton became President, Citizens for a Sound Economy had become a prototype for the kind of
corporate-backed opposition campaigns that have proliferated during the Obama era. The group waged a successful assault on
Clinton's proposed B.T.U. tax on energy, for instance, running advertisements, staging media events, and targeting opponents.
And it mobilized anti-tax rallies outside the Capitol—rallies that NPR described as ""designed to strike fear into the hearts of
wavering Democrats."" Dan Glickman, a former Democratic congressman from Wichita, who supported the B.I.U. tax, recalled,
""I'd been in Congress eighteen years. The Kochs actually engaged against me and funded my opponent. They used a lot of
'resources and effort—their employees, too."" Glickman suffered a surprise defeat. ""I can't prove it, but I think I was probably
their victim,"" he said.
The Kochs continued to disperse their money, creating slippery organizations with generic-sounding names, and this made
it difficult to ascertain the extent of their influence in Washington. In 1990, Citizens for a Sound Economy created a spinoff
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05771774 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05771774 Date: 08/31/2015
group, Citizens for the Environment, which called acid rain and other environmental problems ""myths."" When the
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette investigated the matter, it discovered that the spinoff group had ""no citizen membership of its own.""
In 1997, another Senate investigation began looking into what a minority report called ""an audacious plan to pour millions
of dollars in contributions into Republican campaigns nationwide without disclosing the amount or source,"" in order to evade
campaign-finance laws. A shell corporation, Triad Management, had paid more than three million dollars for attack ads in
twenty-six House races and three Senate races. More than half of the advertising money came from an obscure nonprofit group,
the Economic Education Trust. The Senate committee's minority report suggested that ""the trust was financed in whole or in
part by Charles and David Koch of Wichita, Kansas."" The brothers were suspected of having secretly paid for the attack ads,
most of which aired in states where Koch Industries did business. In Kansas, where Triad Management was especially active,
the funds may have played a decisive role in four of six federal races. The Kochs, when asked by reporters if they had given the
money, refused to comment. In i998, however, the Wall Street Journal confirmed that a consultant on the Kochs' payroll had
been involved in the scheme. Charles Lewis, of the Center for Public Integrity, described the scandal as ""historic. Triad was the
first time a major corporation used a cutout""—a front operation—""in a threatening way. Koch Industries was the poster child of
a company run amok.""
uring the Clinton Administration, the energy industry faced increased scrutiny and regulation. In the mid-nineties, the Justice
Department filed two lawsuits against Koch Industries, claiming that it was responsible for more than three hundred oil spills,
which had released an estimated three million gallons of oil into lakes and rivers. The penalty was potentially as high as two
hundred and fourteen million dollars. In a settlement. Koch Industries paid a record thirty-million-dollar civil fine, and agreed to
spend five million dollars on environmental projects.
In 1999, a jury found Koch Industries guilty of negligence and malice in the deaths of two Texas teen-agers in an explosion
that resulted from a leaky underground butane pipeline. (In 2001, the company paid an undisclosed settlement.) And in the final
months of the Clinton Presidency the Justice Department levelled a ninety-seven-count indictment against the company, for
covering up the discharge of ninety-one tons of benzene, a carcinogen, from its refinery in Corpus Christi, Texas. The company
was liable •for three hundred and fifty million dollars in fines, and four Koch employees faced up to thirty-five years in prison.
The Koch Petroleum Group eventually pleaded guilty to one criminal charge of covering up environmental violations, including
the falsification of documents, and paid a twenty-million-dollar fine. David Uhlmann, a career prosecutor who, at the time,
headed the environmental-crimes section at the Justice Department, described the suit as ""one of the most significant cases ever
brought under the Clean Air Act."" He added, ""Environmental crimes are almost always motivated by economics and arrogance,
and in the Koch case there was a healthy dose of both.""
During the 2000 election campaign, Koch Industries spent some nine hundred thousand dollars to support the candidacies
of George W. Bush and other Republicans. During the Bush years, Koch Industries and other fossil-fuel companies enjoyed
remarkable prosperity. The 2005 energy bill, which Hillary Clinton dubbed the Dick Cheney Lobbyist Energy Bill, offered
enormous subsidies and tax breaks for energy companies. The Kochs have cast themselves as deficit hawks, but, according to a
study by Media Matters, their companies have benefitted from nearly a hundred million dollars in government contracts since
2000.
In 2004, Citizens for a Sound Economy was accused of illegitimately throwing its weight behind Bush's reelection. The
group's Oregon branch had attempted to get Ralph Nader on the Presidential ballot, in order to dilute Democratic support for
John Kerry. Critics argued that it was illegal, for a tax-exempt nonprofit organization to donate its services for partisan political
purposes. (A complaint was filed with the Federal Election Commission; it was dismissed.)
That year, internal rivalries at Citizens for a Sound Economy caused the organization to split apart. David Koch and Fink
started a new group, Americans for Prosperity, and they hired Tim Phillips to run it. Phillips was a political veteran who had
worked with Ralph Reed, the evangelical leader and Republican activist, co-founding Century Strategies, a campaign-
consulting company that became notorious for its ties to the disgraced lobbyist Jack Abramoff. Phillips's online biography
describes him as an expert in ""grasstops"" and ""grassroots"" political organizing. The Kochs' choice of Phillips signalled an even
greater toughness. The conservative operative Grover Norquist, who is known for praising ""throat slitters"" in politics, called
Phillips ""a grownup who can make things happen.""
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05771774 Date: 08/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05771774 Date: 08/31/2015
Last year, Phillips told the Financial Times that Americans for Prosperity had only eight thousand registered members.
Currently, its Web site claims that the group has ""1.2 million activists."" Whatever its size, the Kochs' political involvement has
been intense; a former employee of the Cato Institute told me that Americans for Prosperity ""was micromanaged by the Kochs.""
And the brothers' investment may well have paid off: Americans for Prosperity, in concert with the family's other
organizations, has been instrumental in disrupting the Obama Presidency.
In January, 2008, Charles Koch wrote in his company newsletter that America could be on the verge of ""the greatest loss of
liberty and prosperity since the 1930s."" That October, Americans for Prosperity held a conference of conservative operatives at
a Marriott hotel outside Washington. Erick Erickson, the editor-in-chief of the conservative blog RedState.com, took the lectern,
thanked David Koch, and vowed to ""unite and fiaht ... the armies of the left!"" Sodn after Obama assumed office, Americans
for Prosperity launched ""Porkulus"" rallies against Obama's stimulus-spending measures. Then the Mercatus Center released a
report claiming that stimulus funds had been directed disproportionately toward Democratic districts; eventually, the author was
forced to correct the report, but not before Rush Limbaugh, citing.the paper, had labelled Obama's program ""a slush fund,"" and
Fox News and other conservative outlets had echoed the sentiment. (Phil Kerpen, the vice-president for policy at Americans for
Prosperity, is a contributor to the Fox News Web site. Another officer at Americans for Prosperity, Walter Williams, often
guest-hosts for Limbaugh.)
Americans for Prosperity also created an offshoot, Patients United Now, which organized what Phillips has estimated to be
more than three hundred rallies against health-care reform. Atone rally, an effigy of a Democratic congressman was hung; at
another, protesters unfurled a banner depicting corpses from Dachau. The group also helped organize the ""Kill the Bill"" protests
outside the Capitol, in March, where Democratic supporters of health-care reform alleged that they were spat on and cursed at.
Phillips was a featured speaker.
Americans for Prosperity has held at least eighty events targeting cap-and-trade legislation, which is aimed at making
industries pay for the air pollution that they create. Speakers for the group claimed, with exaggeration, that even back-yard
barbecues and kitchen stoves would be taxed. The group was also involved in the attacks on Obama's ""green jobs"" czar, Van
Jones, and waged a crusade against international climate talks. Casting, his group as a champion of ordinary workers who would
be hurt by environmentalists, Phillips went to Copenhagen last year and staged a protest outside the United Nations conference
on climate change, declaring, ""We're a grassroots organization.... 1 think it's unfortunate when wealthy children of wealthy
families . want to send unemployment rates in the United States up to twenty per cent.""
Grover Norquist, who holds a weekly meeting for conservative leaders in Washington, including representatives from
Americans for Prosperity, told me that last summer's raucous rallies were pivotal in undermining Obama's agenda. The
Republican leadership in Congress, he said, ""couldn't have clone it without August, when people went out on the streets. It
discouraged deal-makers""—Republicans who might otherwise have worked constructively with Obama. Moreover, the
appearance of growing public opposition to Obama affected corporate donors on K Street. ""K Street is a three-billion-dollar
weathervane,"" Norquist said. ""When Obama was strong, the Chamber of Commerce said, 'We can work with the Obama
Administration.' But that changed when thousands of people went into the street and 'terrorized' congressmen. August is what
changed it. Now that Obama is weak, people are getting tough.""
As the first anniversary of Obama's election approached, David Koch came to the Washington area to attend a triumphant
Americans for Prosperity gathering. Obama's poll numbers were falling fast. Not .a single Republican senator was working with
the Administration on health care, or much else. Pundits were writing about Obama's political ineptitude, and Tea Party groups
were accusing the President of initiating ""a government takeover."" In a speech, Koch said, ""Days like today bring to reality the
vision of our board of directors when we started this organization, five years ago."" He went on, ""We envisioned a mass
movement, a state-based one, but national in scope, of hundreds of thousands of American citizens from all walks of life
standing up and fighting for the economic freedoms that made our nation the most prosperous society in history.... Thankfully,
the stirrings from California to Virginia, and from Texas to Michigan, show that more and more of our fellow-citizens are
beginning to see the same truths as we do."" .
While Koch didn't explicitly embrace the Tea Party movement that day, more recently he has come close to doing so,
praising it for demonstrating the ""powerful visceral hostility in the body politic against the massive increase in government

power, the massive efforts to socialize this country."" Charles Koch, in a newsletter sent to his seventy thousand employees,
compared the Obama Administration to the regime of the Venezuelan strongman Hugo Chavez. The Kochs' sense of
imperilment is somewhat puzzling. Income inequality in America is greater than it has been since the nineteen-twenties, and
since the seventies the tax rates of the wealthiest have fallen more than those of the middle class. Yet the brothers' message has
evidently resonated with voters: a recent poll found that fifty-five per cent of Americans agreed that Obama is a socialist.
Americans for Prosperity, meanwhile, has announced that it will spend an additional forty-five million dollars before the
midterm elections, in November. Although the group is legally prohibited from directly endorsing candidates, it nonetheless
plans to target some fifty House races and half a dozen Senate races, staging rallies, organizing door-to-door canvassing, and
running ads aimed at ""educating voters about where candidates stand.""
Though the Kochs have slowed Obama's momentum, their larger political battle is far from won. Richard Fink, interviewed
by FrumForum.com this spring, said, ""If you look at where we've gone from the year 2000 to now, with the expansion of
government spending and a debt burden that threatens to bankrupt the country, it doesn't look very good at all."" He went on, ""It
looks like the infrastructure that was built and ruirtitred has not carried the day."" He suggested that the Kochs needed ""to get
more into the practical, day-to-day issues of governing.""
n 1991, David Koch was badly injured in a plane crash.in Los Angeles. He was the sole passenger in first class to survive. As he
was recovering, a routine physical exam led to the discovery of prostate cancer. Koch received treatment, settled down, started a
family, and reconsidered his life. As he told Portfolio, ""When you're the only one who survived in the front of the plane and
everyone.else died—yeah, you think, 'My God, the good Lord spared me for some greater purpose.' My joke is that I've been
busy ever since, doing all the good work 1 can think of, so He can have confidence in me.""
Koch began giving spectacularly large donations to the arts and sciences. And he became a patron of cancer research,
focussing on prostate cancer. In addition to his gifts to Sloan-Kettering, he gave fifteen million dollars to New York-
Presbyterian Hospital, a hundred and twenty-five million to M.I.T. for cancer research, twenty million to Johns Hopkins
University, and twenty-five million to the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, in Houston. In response to his generosity, Sloan-
Kettering gave Koch its Excellence in Corporate Leadership Award. In 2004, President Bush named him to the National Cancer
Advisory Board, which guides the National.Cancer Institute.
Koch's corporate and political roles, however, may pose conflicts of interest. For example, at the same time that David
Koch has been casting himself as a champion in the fight against cancer, Koch Industries has been lobbying to prevent the
E.P.A. from classifying formaldehyde, which the company produces in great quantities, as a ""known carcinogen"" in humans.
Scientists have long known that formaldehyde causes cancer in rats, and several major scientific studies have concluded
that formaldehyde causes cancer in human beings—including one published last year by the National Cancer Institute, on
•whose advisory board Koch sits. The study tracked twenty-five thousand patients for an average of forty years; subjects exposed
to higher amounts of formaldehyde had significantly higher rates of leukemia. These results helped lead an expert panel within
the National Institutes of Health to conclude that formaldehyde should be categorized as a known carcinogen, and be strictly
controlled by the government. Corporations have resisted regulations on formaldehyde for decades, however, and Koch
Industries has been a large funder of members of Congress who have stymied the E.P.A., requiring it to defer new regulations
until more studies are completed.
Koch Industries became a major producer of the chemical in 2005, after it bought Georgia-Pacific, the paper and wood-
products company, for twenty-one billion dollars. Georgia-Pacific manufactures formaldehyde in its chemical division, and uses
it to produce various wood products, such as plywood and laminates. Its annual production capacity for formaldehyde is 2.2
billion pounds. Last December, Traylor Champion, Georgia-Pacific's vice-president of environmental affairs, sent a formal
letter of protest to federal health authorities. He wrote that the company ""strongly disagrees"" with the N.I.H. panel's conclusion
that formaldehyde should be treated as a known human carcinogen. David Koch did not recuse himself from the National
Cancer Advisory Board, or divest himself of company stock, while his company was directly lobbying the government to keep
formaldehyde on the market. (A board spokesperson said that the issue of formaldehyde had not come up.)
James Fluff, an associate director at the National Institute for Environmental Health Sciences, a division of the N.I.H., told
me that it was ""disgusting"" for Koch to be serving on the National Cancer Advisory Board: ""It's just not good for public health.
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05771774 Date: 08/31/2015

Vested interests should not be on the board."" He 'went on, ""Those boards are very important. They're very influential as to
whether N.C.I. goes into formaldehyde or not. Billions of dollars are involved in formaldehyde.""
Harold Vannus, the director of the National Cancer Institute, knows David Koch from Memorial Sloan-Kettering, which he
used to run. He said that, at Sloan-Kettering, ""a lot of people who gave to us had large business interests. The one thing we
wouldn't tolerate in our board members is tobacco."" When told of Koch Industries' stance on formaldehyde, Varmus said that
he was ""surprised.""
he David H. Koch Hall of Human Origins, at the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History, is a multimedia
exploration of the theory that mankind evolved in response to climate change. At the main entrance, viewers are confronted
with a giant graph charting the Earth's temperature over the past ten million years, which notes that it is far cooler now than it
was ten thousand years ago. Overhead, the text reads, ""HUMANS EVOLVED IN RESPONSE TO A CHANGING WORLD."" The
message, as amplified by the exhibit's Web site, is that ""key human adaptations evolved in response to
environmental instability."" Only at the end of the exhibit, under the headline ""OUR SURVIVAL CHALLENGE,"" is it noted
that levels of carbon dioxide are higher now than they have ever been, and that they are projected to increase
dramatically in the next century. No cause is given for this development; no mention is made of any possible role
played by fossil fuels. The exhibit makes it seem part of a natural continuum. The accompanying text says, ""During
the period in which humans evolved, Earth's temperature and the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere
fluctuated together."" An interactive game in the exhibit suggests that humans will continue to adapt to climate
change in the future. People may build ""underground cities;"" developing ""short, compact bodies"" or ""curved spines,""
so that ""moving around in tight spaces will be no problem.""
Such ideas uncannily echo the Koch message. The company's January newsletter to employees, for instance, argueS that
""fluctuations in the earth's climate predate humanity,"" and concludes, ""Since we can't control Mother Nature, let's figure out
how to get along with her changes."" Joseph Romm, a physicist who runs the Web site ClirnateProgress.org, is infuriated by the
Smithsonian's presentation. ""The whole exhibit whitewashes the modern climate issue,"" he said. ""I think the Kochs wanted to
be seen as some sort of high-minded company, associated with the greatest natural-history and science museum in the country.
But the truth is, the exhibit is underwritten by big-time polluters, who are underground .funders of action to stop efforts to deal
with this threat to humanity. I think the Smithsonian should have drawn the line.""
Cristian Samper, the museum's director, said that the exhibit is not about climate change, and described Koch as ""one of the
best donors we've had, in my tenure here, because he's very interested in the content, but completely hands off."" He noted, ""1.
don't know all the details.of his involvement in other issues.""
The Kochs have long depended on the public's not knowing all the details about them. They have been content to operate what
David Koch has called ""the largest company that you've never heard of."" But with the growing prominence of the Tea Party,
and with increased awareness of the Kochs' ties to the movement, the brothers may find it harder to deflect scrutiny. Recently,
President °barna took aim at the Kochs' political network. Speaking at a Democratic National Committee fund-raiser, in
Austin, he warned supporters that the Supreme Court's recent ruling in the Citizens United case—which struck down laws
prohibiting direct Corporate spending on campaigns—had made it even easier for big companies to hide behind ""groups with
harmless-sounding names like Americans for Prosperity."" Obama said, ""They don't have to say who, exactly, Americans for
Prosperity are. You don't know if it's a foreign-controlled corporation""—or even, he added, ""a big oil company.""

Below please find statements from Kerry, Ros-Lehtinen, Hoekstra, and King.
Haven't seen anything yet from Lugar or Berman.
Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman John Kerry:
""The release of classified information under these circumstances is a reckless action which jeopardizes
lives by exposing raw, contemporaneous intelligence. This is not an academic exercise about freedom of
information and it is not akin to the release of the Pentagon Papers, which involved an analysis aimed at
saving American lives and exposing government deception. Instead, these sensitive cables contain candid
assessments and analysis of ongoing matters and they should remain confidential to protect the ability of
the government to conduct lawful business with the private candor that's vital to effective diplomacy.""

Ros-Lehtinen Condemns Latest Wikileaks Release of Sensitive U.S. Documents
(WASHINGTON) - U.S. Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-FL), Ranking Republican on the House Foreign Affairs
Committee, commented today on the release of scores of sensitive documents by the Wikileaks
website. Statement by Ros-Lehtinen:
""This latest release of classified and other sensitive U.S. documents by Wikileaks is
extremely irresponsible. Those who leak and publish such information are doing great harm
to our nation, and are potentially putting American lives in danger.
""This newest batch of documents appears to contain troves of classified reports related to
our nation's conduct of diplomacy and foreign policy, including reports of critical discussions
with our allies. This is the everyday work-product of our officials all over the globe. This
critical and highly sensitive information must be managed carefully.
""It is deeply disturbing that a few individuals seem to have deemed themselves worthy of
deciding that scores of classified and sensitive material should be paraded about for our
enemies to review and use against us. These leaks come at the expense of U.S. security
and, potentially, American lives.""

From Rep. Pete Hoekstra (R., Mich.) ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee:

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05771905 Date: 08/31/2015
""\Nikileaks clearly is determined to undermine U.S. national security and damage our foreign relations. The
disclosure of thousands of potentially classified cables and other documents is an embarrassment to the
Obama administration and represents a critical failure by the Pentagon and intelligence community to
protect sensitive national security information.
""Once again our partners and allies are forced to question whether the United States can keep secrets,
and our diplomats around the world have been forced to scramble to try and patch-up foreign relations
strained by this illegal leak. ODNI's national counterintelligence executive must move quickly to assess the
failures in this case and to establish security protocols, including robust audit capabilities for classified
networks. Congress also should move quickly to hold hearings to ensure ODNI, the military and FBI have
the necessary counterintelligence authorities to ensure a destructive leak of this nature cannot happen
again.
""The disclosure of these documents by Wikileaks had nothing to do with transparency or whistleblowing,
as the site would claim, and everything to do with undermining American foreign policy. As the world's
number one target for spying by foreign adversaries and now clearly other hacks, the federal government
must do a better job of strengthening America's computer and cybersecurity protocols. If we do not, we
risk leaving exposed an Achilles heel that could cause irreparable damage to our global partnerships and
international standing.""
###
U.S. Representative Peter T. King:
""WikiLeaks presents a clear and present danger to the national security of the United States. I strongly
urge you to work within the Administration to use every offensive capability of the U.S. government to
prevent further damaging releases by WikiLeaks.""

Re: Post mid-terms strategy
What I hear from Republican sources and elsewhere and what it means for Republican strategy:
1. Rove is telling his donors that the ticket in 2012 is Romney/Barbour. Haley Barbour is Rove's
ally. Together they constitute the heart of the GOP establishment. In a potential Republican

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05771375 Date: 08/31/2015
administration Barbour would be a new kind of Cheney, but more politically skillful.
2. Rove is at war with Palin. He has told his donors she must be stopped. Palin is well aware. The
Politico story filled with anonymous quotes about a murky establishment vs. Palin is about the
Death Star of Rove/Barbour. Ironies: Rove doubled down on a base strategy for Bush,
galvanizing the right wing, now spun out of his control to Palin. The GOP used the far right and
Palin in the mid-terms and now have to kill them in presidential nomination politics. Attacking
Palin only builds her stature with the right. She plays instinctively to the base, but can she play a
long game against the big boys determined to destroy her?
3.Palin has already aligned Glenn Beck and Rush Limbaugh on her side. Fox News is being
split. Murdoch gave his big donation to the Republican Governors Association, headed by
Barbour.
4. Malcolm Hoenlein has been raising money hand over fist for the Republicans through Eric
Cantor, now his vehicle. The donors are many of the same US donors to Bibi and Likud.
Implications obvious.
5. The House Republicans have already planned to primary all Senate Republican moderates in
the next cycle. Olympia Snowe is a particular target.
6.In the Senate, Jim DeMint continues to be a Fifth Column of the right, allied to the House
Republicans, against remaining Senate GOP moderates. He will be reinforced after this election
with Rand Paul, et al. Paul, of course, hates Mitch McConnell, and vice versa.
7.McConnell's statement the day before the mid-terms that the goal of the GOP is to make
Obama a one term president is, in fact, their agenda. Everything in the House and Senate will be
bent to that end.
8.Can the House Republicans and Senate Republicans restrain themselves in their own interest
and McConnell's stated aim? Boehner is despised by the younger, more conservative members
of the House Republican Conference. They are repelled by his personal behavior. He is louche,
alcoholic, lazy, and without any commitment to any principle. Boehner has already tried to buy
the members with campaign contributions and committee assignments, which he has already
promised to potentially difficult members. His hold is insecure. He is not Gingrich, the natural
leader of a ""revolution,"" riding the crest into power. He is careworn and threadbare, banal and
hollow, holding nobody's enduring loyalty. Boehner is beholden and somewhat scared of his
base. He twitches when they make gestures that might undermine his position. His impulse is to
hand out money. His aim is to recreate DeLay, Inc, with Jerry Lewis, who will be the new
chairman of Appropriations. But Boehner is neither feared nor loved. He's a would-be DeLay
without the whip. He's the one at the end of the lash. Which means he will be under great
pressure and find it hard to sustain a moderate, reasonable strategy of restraint. McConnell is
relatively in the same position in the Senate. On the other hand, the Congressional Republicans
are vulnerable to a strategy that takes advantage of their internal divisions. Policies/tactics should
be calculated to locate GOP fissures, find political space by widening schisms, and ultimately
break them apart. This is, emphatically, not a strategy of bipartisanship as Obama has pursued it
so far. It is a different and more informed approach.

America and Iran: Strikes, Sanctions and Scapegoats
For the pundits, there are only two questions about U.S.-Iran relations that are of any importance: (1) Will Israel
and/or the United States attack Iran? and (2) will the new sanctions have enough bite to persuade Iran to change
its nuclear policy? Despite all the printers ink spilled on these two issues, the answers are an easy no and no.
Neither the United States nor Israel will take the military option off the table, thereby giving the pundits (and the
crowd that is dying to repeat Iraq) latitude to keep the distant prospect of military action on the front pages,
where it has been for years. As a lede, it sells columns and newspapers, so it will not go away. But as analysis it
is either blinded by the momentary hype or else is simple wish fulfillment.
Uber-neocon John Bolton had it right. If any such attack were to occur, it would have been at the end of the Bush
administration when there was nothing left to lose. Bolton thought it was so inevitable that he predicted it
unequivocally in a Wall Street Journal column in 2008. Dick Cheney apparently agreed, judging from his
subsequent statements of regret. So it is fair to say that George W. Bush, after looking the potential
consequences, resisted the advice of his neocon advisers, his previously dominant vice president, and the
reported direct request from the government of Israel — and rejected a strike. What is the likelihood that Barack
Obama, with the same catastrophic scenario before him, will approve? Forget it.
Sanctions do not persuade dictatorial regimes to abandon projects that they think are central to their security
and survival or even their self-image. Just look at Saddam Hussein. The international sanctions imposed on Iraq
in the 1980s make the current Iran sanctions appear anemic in comparison. Every item that went in and out of
Iraq was subject to approval by a UN committee dominated by a vindictive United States. Yet, although Iraq had
abandoned its nuclear weapons program years earlier, Saddam could not bring himself to let his own people and
his enemies know that. Instead he was prepared to gamble that the United States would not attack him.
One of the reasons for this bad bet was that he and his cronies were doing so well under the sanctions that there
was no immediate necessity to come clean. They, after all, controlled the smuggling routes. And their henchmen
managed the thriving and enormously lucrative black market. As for concern with their own people, a rotund
Tariq Aziz, sitting with a fine Scotch and a Cuban cigar, informed a worried UN representative that it would be
good for the Iraqi people to lose some weight. An Iraqi friend of mine told me at the time that the sanctions had
made criminals of the entire Iraqi middle class, which had to resort to illegal behavior in order to survive. The
biggest – and most successful – of this new criminal class was the privileged group immediately around Saddam
Hussein.
Which brings us to Iran. The sanctions are more effective than many anticipated. They have built a web of
financial restrictions and limitations around the already weak Iranian economy that is certain to cause significant
problems for the leadership. Iran's critical energy sector is particularly vulnerable. It is in a pincer. Because of
cheap energy prices inside the country, artificially propped up by massive subsidies, energy demand is soaring.
This siphons off a lot of Iran's oil production, which would otherwise be sold on the world market for hard
currency.
At the same time, because Iran's oil fields are old and complex, they require modern technology to maintain
production. That technology – and the capital investment that can only be provided by the major international oil
companies – has been absent for many years. It was driven away partly by the sanctions, ironically assisted by
Iran's own short-sighted negotiating tactics that offered only the most meager profit margins to outside
investors. As a result, Iran's oil production is in decline at the same time that more and more of it is being soaked
up by domestic consumption. In a period of relatively low oil prices, this means that Iran's hard currency
earnings are drying up at an alarming rate.
This unenviable economic situation is compounded by what has to be described as perhaps the least competent
economic management team of any major country in the world. Ayatollah Khamene'i, the Supreme Leader,
seems totally preoccupied with bolstering his own shaky political legitimacy by pandering to the Revolutionary
Guards who surround and protect him. The result is corruption on a scale beyond anything the shah's regime
could have imagined.
President Ahmadinejad, also a creature of the Revolutionary Guards, is free to indulge his taste for outlandish
and irresponsible rhetoric. His words keep the international and domestic spotlight glued to him; but the effect
drives away prospective investors and facilitates the U.S. drive to enlist international support for sanctions
against Iran. An American Jewish leader once joked with me that he suspected Ahmadinejad was a Mossad
agent: no one, he observed, had been more helpful in promoting donations to Israel and Israeli causes. At the
same time, under his leadership Iran has inflation and unemployment that are both in double digits.
But to be fair, Ahmadinejad is the first politician in modern Iranian history willing to address the ""third rail"" of
Iranian politics — the immensely costly subsidies on food and energy. His initial efforts to reduce the amount of
subsidized gasoline that Iranians could use met with outbursts of indignation, including torching filling stations.
But these rules now seem to be grudgingly accepted and have eased slightly Iran's energy dilemma. He is now
addressing the low tax rates assessed against merchants. This has also resulted in outrage, including closing
the bazaars in Iran and other major cities. But his campaign seems to be making progress.
These are needed reforms that would be recommended by any responsible economic overseer, including the
International Monetary Fund. Ahmadinejad attempts to balance his daring assaults on the entrenched economic
interests by his belligerent rhetoric, always casting himself as the champion of the little guy. In that he resembles
his populist predecessors, from Juan Peron to Huey Long to Hugo Chavez. Ahmadinejad takes on America and
Israel the way Governor Long took on Standard Oil. But like other populists, Ahmadinejad is the prisoner of his
own eccentric view of the world and his loyalty to lieutenants who may or may not be worthy of his faith in them.
The key question about Iran today is not whether it will be attacked or collapse under sanctions. It is whether Iran
is capable under its present leadership to take a sober decision about how to deal with the outside world. The
Revolutionary Guards have established a dominant position in Iran's military, its economy, and its politics. Iran
increasingly comes to resemble the corporatist states of southern and eastern Europe in the 1920s and '30s that
we call fascist. Iran is conducting an interior battle with its own demons, from the millenarians on the far right
who choose to believe that Khamene'i is the personal representative of God on earth, to the pragmatic
conservatives who simply want a more responsible leadership, to the reformists of the Green movement whose
objective is to put the ""republic"" back into the Islamic Republic by giving the people a greater voice.
This is a yeasty and unpredictable mix. No one knows what is going to happen next.
And this is the reality that the Obama administration must deal with. The danger is not that the administration will
back the wrong horse in Iran. The real danger is that the Obama administration will be so preoccupied with
domestic American politics and its constant demand to look tough when dealing with Iran that it will
inadvertently rescue this cruel but hapless regime from its own ineptitude by providing a convenient scapegoat
for everything that goes wrong in Iran.","UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770377 Date: 08/31/2015

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Statement by Ambassador Susan E. Rice, U.S. Permanent Representative to the United Nations, on Secretary
General Ban's Panel Concerning the May 31 Flotilla Incident
The United States welcomes today's announcement by UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon of the
establishment of a Panel regarding the incident of May 31st- We thank both governments for the constructive
and cooperative spirit they have shown and the Secretary General for his leadership and determination. The
Panel, which has the support of both Israel and Turkey, will receive and review the reports of each
government's national investigation into the incident and make recommendations as to how to avoid such
incidents in the future. This Panel is not a substitute for those national investigations. It complements them,
affording Israel and Turkey the opportunity to present the conclusions of their investigations to the international
community. The focus of the Panel is appropriately on the future and on preventing such incidents from
recurring. The United States also hopes that the Panel can serve as a vehicle to enable Israel and Turkey to
move beyond the recent strains in their relationship and repair their strong historic ties.
The United States expects that the Panel will operate in a transparent and credible manner and that its work will
be the primary method for the international community to review the incident, obviating the need for any
overlapping international inquiries. The United States welcomes the naming of the former Prime Minister of
New Zealand, Geoffrey Palmer, as Chair and the outgoing President of Colombia, Alvaro Uribe, as Vice-Chair.
We look forward to the announcement of the two additional members from Israel and Turkey.

what others were doing, and I said I'd get back to her. Answer is below. Could you pls pass
this info along? Thanks.
Eleven European countries (France, Italy, Germany, Poland, Ukraine, Bulgaria, Turkey,
Azerbaijan, Armenia, Belarus and Latvia) have supplied firefighters (515 total currently in
Russia) and heavy firefighting equipment (fire trucks, mobile pumping stations, bulldozers
etc.), three airplanes and six helicopters. Italy and France are providing the fire fighting
aircraft. The European Commission has offered to transport affected children to EU states or
non-affected areas of Russia for treatment of respiratory illnesses. It has also provided masks,
water, health assistance, and general non-food items. China has provided $4m total in cash and
relief supplies so far. NATO offered to help but Moscow was uninterested.
U.S. assistance totals $4.5m, including $3.5m in specialized firefighting equipment, $350k in
planned capacity building, and $50k in humanitarian assistance (bedding, food parcels). Russia
has publicly thanked the U.S. for its assistance.

Re: British election
First and most important: Do NOT, repeat, NOT, call any prospective winner on
either Election Night, May 6, or on the next day, Friday, May 7. The result will
be unclear. It will not be clear, even perhaps by Friday afternoon. Today, the
combined polls show Cameron and the Conservatives ahead but not winning an
outright majority. The latest Guardian poll, out tomorrow, shown me by Alan
Rusbridger today, has the Tories falling short of a majority of seats. Even if
Cameron were to win an outright majority, Brown and Labour will attempt to make
a deal with Clegg and the Liberal Democrats. Brown remains as Prime Minister
unless the Tories win outright, which take a long time to determine. Labour and
the Lib-Dems will almost certainly gain about 60 percent of the vote, more or
less. Brown will reach out to Clegg to stay in power. The deal will be that
Brown will approve a referendum on proportional representation giving the LDs
much greater representationin future elections. That will spell the end forever
of the Tories ever coming to power. The Tories see the election in apocalyptic
terms—and they are not wrong. Brown's weakness heralds the sort of grand
progressive coalition/alliance that Tony imagined but was never able to attempt
between Labour and the LDs. Brown offering the referendum would be the first
step toward that. In the case of the Tories falling short of an outright
majority in seats, they will respond as though Brown is acting illegitimately,
which he would not be by remaining as PM and dealing with Clegg. Informed people
are already talking of what might begin to unfold on Friday as ""Florida."" The
Tories, backed by the Murdoch press, will attempt to push Labour aside by force
majeure—something that will not succeed under those circumstances. The Murdochs
are almost literally going crazy. James Murdoch and hiw wife stormed into the
offices of The Independent, not a Murdoch paper, when the paper endorsed the LDs

and confronted the publisher, screaming in the middle of the newsroom. Murdoch
would be a big, big loser if Cameron loses. Another possibile outcome is that
the Conservatives come up just short and attempt their own deal with the DUP to
cover the gap in seats. Shaun is on to this potential, has been talking to Peter
Robinson.
No matter what, keep your powder dry until the result is crystal clear. Wait.

USS IWO JIMA DEPLOYS TO HAITI AS TROPICAL STORM APPROACHES
MIAMI - U.S. Southern Command directed the amphibious ship USS Iwo Jima
(LHD 7) to steam toward Haiti today in preparation for the forecasted
arrival of tropical storm Tomas later this week.
Iwo Jima will deploy to Haiti from Suriname, where it arrived Thursday
on its final country visit for Continuing Promise 2010, a four-month,
humanitarian civic assistance deployment to eight nations in the
Caribbean region. The ship is scheduled to arrive in Haiti later this
week.
Large amphibious ships, like Iwo Jima, resemble small aircraft carriers
and include the ability to support helicopter and landing craft
operations to quickly move personnel and cargo, making it an ideal
platform to support humanitarian-relief missions on short notice.
A crew of 1,600 military and civilian medical, engineering, aviation,
logistical and other support personnel are embarked aboard Iwo Jima,
including U.S. Navy engineers, a contingent of 500 Marines with
logistical-support expertise, volunteers from the U.S. Public Health
Service and various non-governmental organizations (NG05), as well as
medical, dental and engineering professionals from Europe, North America
and South America.
Eight CH-46 Sea Knight, medium-lift, dual-rotor helicopters; two MH-60
Knight Hawk helicopters and two amphibious landing craft units (LCU's)
are on Iwo Jima to support the ship's operations.
Iwo Jima is a Wasp-class amphibious ship capable of speeds in excess of
20 knots that can provide robust ship-to-shore, as well as
shore-to-shore logistics support during contingencies ranging from
traditional military operations to humanitarian and disaster-relief
missions.
Because of the Caribbean region's history of severe-weather- events
during the peak months of the hurricane season, the ship has remained in
the area throughout its present deployment, ready to support U.S.
disaster relief efforts when directed.
Iwo Jima was in Port-de-Paix, Haiti, from July 24 through Aug. 3. It was
the first stop on CP10 and the crew provided medical assistance to more
than 4,000 Haitian citizens, performed 32 surgeries, completed six
engineering projects, and delivered 231 pallets of
humanitarian-assistanCe supplies donated by NG0s.
In September 2008, the amphibious ship USS Kearsarge deployed to Haiti

The Secretary did such a mitzvah by recording a video message for us encouraging American families to host
exchange students. In a few short days the video has had a tremendous impact. We have heard from so many
people who work to recruit host families about what a major effect the video will have on their efforts. One
person even described showing the video on her mobile phone to someone who then agreed on the spot to host
an exchange student for the first time. In addition to the anecdotal stories we are hearing, the video has had
almost 6,500 views on our YouTube page, which is unheard of for an ECA-related video—especially one that's
only been up 2 days!
Recruiting host families and schools is a continual challenge, and is it imperative to the success of our programs
so we are so grateful for her contribution. This little bit will go a very long way. Please pass on our
appreciation to her.

Subject line: Secretary Clinton, my physical therapist's office, and YFU...
Dear fellow YFU'ers,
Earlier this week I was in my physical therapist's office filling out volumes of paperwork. I happened to be wearing my
YFU polo shirt, and the receptionist asked what Youth For Understanding was all about. While I was telling her, my Palm
beeped that I had a new message — it happened to be an email produced by the State Department of Secretary Clinton's
endorsement of hosting and international exchange. I opened the email and clicked on the link. The two receptionists, a
nurse and I huddled around my phone and watched Clinton speak to the importance of global exchange.
Luckily, I had saved several student profiles in my phone and was able to show the receptionists some of the unplaced
students right then and there. I am not sure whether it was the video or the profiles but once I told her my own YFU story,
one of the receptionists was hooked. She already has a student picked out, and her host family application is being
completed today! It feels wonderful to change the life of a teenager thousands of miles away and a newfound friend in my
own backyard.

Dear Friends and Colleagues:
What if we told you a little-known bureaucratic process called ""Implementation and Procurement Reform,""
IPR for short, was one of the biggest victories for poor people in years? It means more aid can go directly
through a country's own systems, making them stronger. It also means that more aid will be administered
by local organizations who know best what their own communities need.
Through IPR, USAID is putting President Obama's recent global development policy into action. The agency
has set clear targets to increase use of local country systems and organizations, which means that US
assistance will help citizens and their governments build their own capacity, instead of setting up a parallel
system as they've done in recent years. They've set clear and ambitious targets for themselves that are
laser-focused on results, and dedicated to fighting global poverty not just in the short term, but for good.

This reform will likely be criticized by some who think that putting more money in the hands of local actors
will expose USAID's programs to more risk. But this is precisely the point; only by supporting local change
agents—both inside and outside developing country governments—can we actually strengthen the hands of
people in poor countries who are working to change their own societies for the better. That means managing
risk wisely, rather than trying to avoid it altogether. And in our field research, 36 of the 39 activists we
interviewed said they want USAID to support their government's directly, because it would make it easier for
them to hold their governments accountable and prevent corruption.
What does all this mean? It means better aid, aid that strengthens the capacity of reformers in poor countries.
And for the millions of people across the world who have been demanding these reforms, USAID has shown
it is actively listening.
Sincerely,
The Aid Effectiveness Team

November 27, 2010
By JACK HEALY
BAGHDAD — Prime Minister Nuni Kamal al-Maliki, seeking to show that he is in control of a tenuous new
ruling coalition, said Saturday that he would push ahead to form a new government with or without potential
allies, and that there was no need for American troops to remain in Iraq past a December 2011 deadline for
withdrawal.
In his first news conference since being formally nominated as prime minister two days ago, Mr. Maliki
acknowledged the growing frustration of Iraqis, who have watched their leaders collect salaries of up to $11,000
a month and fly off to their second homes while in much of the country's electricity remains sporadic and
violent attacks continue.
Mr. Maliki's remarks also reflected the splinters that remained inside Iraq's nascent partnership government,
and the competing interests of political groups that have coalesced behind him.
There is no need for American troops to remain in Iraq beyond December 2011, Mr. Maliki said, apparently in a
nod to the followers of the anti-American Shiite cleric Moktada al-Sadr, who have promised to fight any
attempt to maintain an American military presence here.
The Sadrists have played a critical role in supporting Mr. Maliki for a second term after indecisive elections in
March. Some American and Iraqi officials have argued that a residual force is necessary to continue training
Iraqi soldiers and help maintain military equipment, but on Saturday, Mr. Maliki said the Iraqis could stand
alone.
""I don't see a need for any other international forces to help Iraqis control the security situation,"" he said.
Iraqi officials announced Saturday that they had arrested 12 people who orchestrated a bloody siege against a
Christian church here last month. They called the arrests evidence of improvements in the country's security
forces.
Interior Ministry officials said the insurgents had ties to Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia, and had also planned to also
blow up the main gates of the International Zone, where the United States Embassy is located. Officials said
they had seized 6 suicide belts, 10 improvised explosive devices and 5 tons of bomb-making material as a result
of the arrests.

At his news conference, Mr. Maliki, a religious Shiite, said he wanted the new government to include his main
rival, Ayad Allawi, whose Iraqiya coalition won the most support among Iraq's Sunni minority. But Mr. Maliki
indicated he would move forward with or without Mr. Allawi, who has sharply criticized the power-sharing
deal.
""If we reach the critical area and we have to announce the government, we will go on with who is beside us,
who wants to be a partner,"" Mr. Maliki said.
Mr. Allawi, a secular Shiite and former Iraqi prime minister, has been offered a position leading a new strategic
policy council, but has not said whether he will accept the job.
For Mr. Maliki, the clock is ticking. He now has four weeks to cobble together a government that satisfies most
demands of the country's ethnic, religious and political factions.
He said he had sent letters asking the different coalitions for nominations for key government offices, and
would announce his ministers by Dec. 10 or 15.

I'm taking a break from peeling potatoes to report the following:
I've circulated a call sheet for your conversation with Bibi to the group and asked them to look at it tomorrow morning
(no need to make them do it today) so that we can have a consensus recommendation for how you should approach the

Cheryl,
One sappy statement before I fly. Your involvement in the QDDR process has always been extremely helpful. Most of the
best QDDR chairs meetings were those in which you participated, due in large part to the rigor and critical thought you
brought to every issue. From the beginning of the process, your critical analysis and thoughtfulness in these meetings
made all of us think more deeply. I have been grateful for that approach many times throughout the QDDR.
We've come a long way since that first meeting in which I described this as a ""capabilities review"" and organizational
change exercise — all met with some frustration or blank stares. I think we've ended this phase on a great note. The
amount of positive feedback we've received and the eagerness to start implementation are great signs heading into
implementation.
You are clearly one of the hardest working people in this building and have done so much to define and implement the
Secretary's vision on so many things. So thanks for everything you've done on the QDDR and for everything else you do.
As discussed today, I'm not far away if you need anything.

RIYADH (AFP)— An ""inept"" United States cannot fix Afghanistan's problems and should simply focus on ""chasing the
terrorists"" there, former Saudi intelligence chief Prince Turki al-Faisal said on Saturday.
The ex-ambassador to the United States also challenged Washington to produce results in just-started Middle East
peace talks, and accused US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton of undermining efforts to make the region nuclear-free.
AFP — Saudi Arabia's former intelligence chief Prince Turki al-Faisal delivers a speech during a conference ...
In a speech in Riyadh before diplomats, Turki said US-led NATO troops had irrevocably alienated the Afghan people and
had no hope of rebuilding the country.
""What Afghanistan needs now is a shift from nation-building to effectively countering terrorists,"" Turki told the Arab
News conference.
US President Barack Obama ""should not be misdirected into believing that he can fix Afghanistan's ills by military
means.""
""Hunt down the terrorists on both sides of the Afghan-Pakistan border, arrest them or kill them, and get out, and let the
Afghan people deal with their problems.
""As long as GI boots remain on Afghan soil, they remain targets of resistance for the Afghan people and ideological
mercenaries.""
Turki, who has long served a central role in Saudi-Afghan relations, scolded Washington's handling of relations with
Kabul.
""The inept way in which this administration has dealt with President (Hamid) Karzai beggars disbelief and amazement.
""Both sides are now filled with resentment and a sour taste in their mouths,"" he said. ""How can they both get out of that
situation? I don't know.""
The chairman of the King Faisal Center For Research and Islamic Studies, Turki has no official position but is believed to
often reflect high level thinking in the Saudi government.
He is the brother of Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal, and analysts speculate he could become foreign minister
when Saud retires.
Turki said Arab states have given Washington four months to show progress in US-guided Palestinian-Israeli peace talks.
""The Arab world has given Obama until September to get things done,"" said Turki.
""It is not enough to talk the talk. He has to walk the walk.
""If he does not succeed... then I (will) ask President Obama to do the morally decent gesture and recognise the
Palestinian state that he so ardently wishes to exist.
""He can then pack up and leave us in peace and let the Palestinians, Syrians and Lebanese negotiate directly with the
Israelis. No more platitudes and good wishes and visions, please.""
Turki also faulted the US and European approach in trying to halt Iran's alleged efforts to build a nuclear weapon.
""The discussions on Iran's nuclear ambitions started off on the wrong foot. The carrot and stick approach does not
work,"" he said.
For one, he said, the US and Europe have had double-standards in dealing with Iran on the one hand, and other nuclear
countries on the other.
""You cannot ask Iran to play on one level while you allow Israel, India, Pakistan, and North Korea to play on other levels.""
Turki said a successful strategy toward Iran requires even-handedness, a ""universal nuclear security umbrella"" for the
countries in the area, and ""a good military option"" against any regional country which does not cooperate.
He said Clinton had undermined efforts to move toward a regional nuclear-free zone, after the UN Security Council's five
permanent members recently expressed support for the idea.
""Alas... Clinton then voided the issue of its value by stating that the conditions do not yet exist for establishing the zone,""
he said.
""Why, then, did she join the other members of the P5 in issuing their statement?""
Turki said he hoped Obama ""will find the way to correct his secretary of state's nullification of making our area free of
weapons of mass destruction.""
Turki also warned of rising violence in Iraq after the pullout of US troops next year, warning both internal and external
groups seek to carve up the country.
""Imagine what will happen once internal strife and fighting escalates"" following the US pullout, he said.
Without a UN Security Council effort to protect Iraq's current borders, the consequence could be ""regional conflict on a
scale not seen since the Ottoman-Safavid wars of the 17th and 18th centuries,"" he warned.","UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05770549 Date: 08/31/2015

Please Pass to the Secretary
Madame Secretary,
A shoot out occurred on August 20 in front of the American School in Monterrey (AFSM), resulting in the death of two
bodyguards. An investigation is continuing into the details, but our understanding at this point is that it was an
attempted kidnapping targeting the relatives of a local business executive. While it does not appear that U.S. families
were targeted, the sharp increase in kidnapping incidents in the Monterrey area, and this event in particular, present a
very high risk to the families of U.S. citizens who might be become incidental victims.
U.S. security and law enforcement personnel have engaged local and federal security officials to seek their help on
understanding the immediate risks and measures that can be taken. I have urged U.S. families at the Consulate in
Monterrey not to send their children to school in the coming days while we review the events that took place on August
20. We also are advising U.S. citizens in the area that we have urged Consulate personnel not to send their children to
school while we complete this security review.

I am sure that the warden notice will lead to a rash of press reports on U.S. concerns about security in Monterrey. More
broadly, if the government cannot get the kidnappings in Monterrey under control, that may affect our ability to
function in Monterrey. I have advised Secretary Espinosa of this, and have sought her help as well to address consulate
security.
Consulate personnel are currently on ""authorized departure"" and have the option to send their families to a U.S.
location. Pat Kennedy is in close touch on these matters.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE
WASHINGTON
April 20, 2010
The Honorable Kent Conrad, Chairman
Committee on the Budget
United States Senate
Washington, D.C. 205.10
Dear Mr. Chairman:
I am asking yourrhelp in supporting the State and USAID budget-request for
FY 2011. 1 appreciate the difficult budget envimnment that confronts the
Congress, but I strongly believe this budget request is critical to advancing U.S.
national security and our interests around the world.
Our request totals $52.8 billion — a $4.9 billion increase over 2010. Of that
increase, $3.6 billion goes directly to ""frontline states"" — Afghanistan, Pakistan,
and Iraq. All other State and USAID funding grows by $1.3 billion or a 2.7
percent increase, and allows us to tackle the transnational problems of poverty.
food insecurity, climate change, and disease that pose serious threats to American
interests.
Our diplomatic and development tools alliance American leadership,
strengthen our alliances, and build new partnerships to confront pressing global
challenges. Full fimding in FY 11 will allow (LS to continue making tangible
progress in securing the hard fought gains achieved in 'Iraq, and to continue
supporting and deploying hundreds of civilians in Afghanistan and Pakistan to help.

The recent attacks on United States persOnnel and facilities from Juarez.
Mexico. to Peshawar, Pakistan, reinforce what we already know -- America's
diplomats and development professionals are on the front lines, protecting. and
securing our vital national security interests around the world.
Congress has rightly demanded that we use all the tools in our national
security tool belt; that we put more diplomats and development experts on the
ground, shoulder-to-shoulder with our troops; and that we do everything possible
to secure America's interests aroun.d the world.. We are doing our part at the State
Department and USAID, but we need your help with the FY II request. Our

missions are increasingly integrated with those of our Defense Department
counterparts, as we have seen demonstrated time and again in Iraq, Afghanistan,
and other parts of the world. Cuts to the civilian components can no longer be seen
in isolation or having little impact on our national security strategy.
Our investments in development and diplemacy are smart, cost-effective,
and squarely in the best interests of American taxpayers and our national security.
They are also relatively small compared to the cost of active military engagement,
and they can end up delivering impactful savings. In Iraq, lbr example, our $2.6
billion request for State and USAID will allow the Defense Department budget to
decrease by about $16 billion — a powerful illustration of the return on civilian
investments.
I ask ibr your strong support of our budget request and you have my pledge
that we will work diligently to ensure that this funding is used as efficiently and
effectively as possible.
Sincerely yours,
Hillary Rodham Clinton

Subject: From Arturo - Correa Rescued in Ecuador
Madame Secretary: After a tense day in which President Correa was slightly injured at noon by rioting and striking
police, and later was barred from leaving the hospital by the same, the army finally rescued him at 9pm last night. Some
military units, including the Navy unit in Guayaquil appeared to support the police. The police also occupied the national
congress. As the rescue took place, the head of the Ecuadoran Joints Chiefs of Staff issued a statement supporting the
president, and noting that the armed forces respect the rule of law ""in which the President [Rafael Correa] is the
maximum authority of the three branches."" Things are now calm.
Reaction in the hemisphere was one of deep concern. The OAS adopted a resolution; South American presidents at the
call of UNASUR travelled to Buenos Aires and are likely to go on to Quito to support Correa. Several, including Garcia
and Santos, called Correa. Zapatero also spoke with him. Moratinos tried to reach you at around 6pm last evening to
convey that news, I took the call.
As you know, we issued a statement of support for Correa. I also gave an interview to CNN in Spanish, which was re-
played frequently. I strongly recommend that you call Correa today to reiterate U.S. support for his government and to
wish him well.
He will appreciate it but, more broadly, it sends a signal that the United States supports the constitutional order and
rejects any attempt to undermine it. Chavez in Buenos Aires predictably declared that we were behind the unrest. We
have prepared a call sheet for you.

HANOI - Secretary Clinton expressed concern over Vietnam's arrests of dissidents, attacks on religious groups and curbs
on Internet freedom, but said the countries remained friends. The United States and Communist-run Vietnam marked
15 years of diplomatic ties this month and Clinton said the two countries had ""learned to see each other not as former
enemies but as actual and potential partners, colleagues and friends. We have consistently moved in the direction of
engagement and cooperation, even on those issues where we disagree."" Clinton spoke during a two-day visit to Hanoi
for the Asia-Pacific region's biggest security dialogue.

The administration's response seems quite weak to me.
This is not like the Pentagon Papers or even the videos of the bombings, this is a wholesale capturing of the diplomatic
material of the country. No State department can operate if it can't keep its own classified cables and internal orders
confidential — Ithink this is unprecedented in history. And if this is wikileaks can get, what can the Chinese or other able
to secure?
The issues surrounding the content are significant and could have legs.
But this security breach is not a targeted breach to make a whistle blower point, it is a wholesale leak that should be
treated as putting lives in danger. For what it is worth, I think you need to order a full scale review and upgrading of the
cyber security of the state department immediately. To offer a bounty for the capture of those responsible. And as I see
you doing, take an aggressive position on Wikileaks. Just being seen as apologizing for the content is weak compared to
reacting and acting to shore up the key principles behind security and aggressively dealing with the problem directly.
For what it's worth, that's my view.

Re: Latest on UK (5:15 pm, Friday, London); plus Euro and Tony
Everyone has their favorite scenario, but it seems fairly obvious that it will be almost impossible
for Gordon to hang on. This process may take some days. Jonathan, who knows Clegg, says he's
basically not who his voters think he is but a pro-Europeanist Tory. When Clegg was
contemplating a political career he consulted Jonathan. Clegg comes from a Tory family.
Jonathan told him to become a Tory, join a real political party rather than the Lib Dems, but
Clegg thought he would advance further with LDs. So several theories: 1. Clegg makes an
outright deal with Cameron, including for some form of proportional representation (giving LDs
more seats in future elections) and cabinet positions. Clegg might become foreign secretary
under this scenario. This is the scenario Jonathan believes may well happen. 2. Clegg supports
Cameron to form a minority government, but doesn't go into a coalition. Instead his deal involves
Cameron dropping almost the whole Tory program but a joint program on financial recovery to
be proposed in the Queen's Speech (equivalent of State of the Union). I find this far-fetched. But
who knows? 3. Clegg supports Cameron to form government, makes no deals. Jonathan
Freedland, who spent last week with Clegg, told me today that Clegg told him a deal with
Gordon would appear dirty. Yet making a deal with Cameron would also make Clegg to be a
dealmaker, even without a deal on program. These are the convolutions people are going through
waiting for resolution. Then, Gordon: Gordon is trying to figure out how to form a coalition.
Clegg is refusing him. Gordon may propose Clegg's maximum demands to him to see if he will
publicly refuse them. Hard to know when this comes to a head and if and when Gordon departs.
Jonathan told me that Tony's view is that Gordon will go but that he couldn't see how Gordon
would understand it or exactly how he would go. Barring any clear process, skipping ahead,
David appears to be frontrunner for successor as leader of opposition. He would be well
positioned to be the future PM if he plays it right under these circumstances. More to come...
Also:
1. You might consider making a statement on Europe and the financial crisis, not a detailed
policy statement but a general statement, a little music to position support for Merkel, which she

would greatly appreciate, especially facing a harsh regional election in North Rhineland. I would
make it short and sweet, simply something about the US commitment to the European project,
there from the beginning, is as strong and steadfast as ever; that the US supports Merkel's efforts
(and mention Sarkozy) to stabilize Europe and the Euro, etc. Timing TBD, but soon.
2. Tony says he ready and willing to do more on the Middle East if you want to use him.

G.O.P. Leader Is Tightly Bound to Lobbyists
By ERIC LIPTON
WASHINGTON — House Democrats were preparing late last year for the first floor vote on the financial regulatory
overhaul when Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio and other Republican leaders summoned more than 100 industry
lobbyists to Capitol Hill for a private strategy session.
The bill's passage in the House already seemed inevitable. But Mr. Boehner and his deputies told the Wall Street
lobbyists and trade association leaders that by teaming up, they could still perhaps block its final passage or at least water
it down.
""We need you to get out there and speak up against this,"" Mr. Boehner said that December afternoon, according to three
people familiar with his remarks, while also warning against cutting side deals with Democrats.
That sort of alliance — they won a few skirmishes, though they lost the war on the regulatory bill — is business as usual
for Mr. Boehner, the House minority leader and would-be speaker if Republicans win the House in November. He
maintains especially tight ties with a circle of lobbyists and former aides representing some of the nation's biggest
businesses, including Goldman Sachs, Google, Citigroup, R. J. Reynolds, MillerCoors and UPS.
They have contributed hundreds of thousands of dollars to his campaigns over the years, provided him rides on their
corporate jets, socialized with him at luxury golf resorts and waterfront bashes and are now leading fund-raising efforts for
his Boehner for Speaker campaign, which is soliciting checks of up to $37,800 each, the maximum allowed.
Some of the lobbyists readily acknowledge routinely seeking his office's help — calling the congressman and his aides as
often as several times a week — to advance their agenda in Washington. And in many cases, Mr. Boehner has helped
them out.
As Democrats increasingly try to cast the Ohio congressman as the face of the Republican Party — President Obama
mentioned his name eight times in a speech last week — and as Mr. Boehner becomes more visible, his ties to lobbyists,
cultivated since he arrived here in 1991, are coming under attack.
The woman he hopes to replace, Speaker Nancy Pelosi, derided him on Friday as having met ""countless times with
special-interest lobbyists in an effort to stop tough legislation"" that would regulate corporations and protect consumers.
And the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, through a spokeswoman, charged that he ""epitomizes the
smoked-filled, backroom, special-interest deal making that turns off voters about Washington.""
Mr. Boehner, who declined to be interviewed for this article, and his lobbyist allies ridicule such criticism as politically
motivated by desperate Democrats. His actions, they say, simply reflect the pro-business, antiregulatory philosophy that
he has espoused for more than three decades, dating back to when Mr. Boehner, the son of a tavern owner, ran a small
plastics company in Ohio. And fielding requests from lobbyists is nothing unusual, he says.
""I get lobbied every day by somebody,"" he said last month after a speech in Cleveland. ""It could be by my wife. It could be
the bellman. It goes on all day, everyday, everyplace.""
Mr. Boehner — a 60-year-old, perpetually tanned, sharply tailored, chain-smoking golfer — is not as fiery as Newt
Gingrich or as unrelenting an arm-twister as Tom DeLay, two of his Republican predecessors in top House posts. It is his
reputation as a ""Chamber of Commerce"" Republican and his fund-raising skills — he has raised $36 million for
Republican causes during this election cycle, more than almost anyone else in his party — that explain, in part, his rise.
If elected as his party's leader in the House, Mr. Boehner will certainly lean on his industry allies for help as he builds
coalitions necessary to push legislation through Congress, his office acknowledges. His friends say there is nothing wrong
with that.
""Does he have a lot of relationships in this city? Yes, absolutely,"" said Mark lsakowitz, a friend whose Republican firm
represents more than three dozen financial, telecommunications, energy and consumer products companies as diverse
as Coca-Cola and Zurich Financial Services. ""But I think all the good lawmakers do.""
Mr. Boehner won some of his first national headlines back in 1996 after he was caught handing out checks from tobacco
lobbyists to fellow Republicans on the House floor. Then the fourth-ranking House Republican, Mr. Boehner said he had
broken no rules and was simply assisting his lobbyist friends, who were contributing to other Republicans' campaigns.
His business-friendly reputation was enhanced through the weekly powwows he organized on Capitol Hill nicknamed the
Thursday Group, a gathering of conservative leaders and business lobbyists whom he relied on to help push the party's
legislative agenda. The Thursday gathering was disbanded after a Republican power struggle that cost him his leadership
position.
But he continued to routinely meet with business leaders, particularly in his role as chairman of the Education and the
Workforce Committee, and returned to power as House G.O.P. leader in 2006. Several of the onetime Thursday regulars,
along with some newcomers, are among the close-knit group that routinely call on Mr. Boehner's office for client matters,
write checks to his campaign and socialize with him.
That tight circle includes Mr. lsakowitz; Bruce Gates, a lobbyist for the cigarette maker Altria; Nicholas E. Calio, a
Citigroup lobbyist; and two former aides, Marc Lampkin and Sam Geduldig, both now financial services lobbyists.
The tobacco industry is particularly well represented, with both Mr. Gates and John Fish, a lobbyist for R. J. Reynolds,
maker of Camel cigarettes, in the group. People affiliated with those companies have contributed at least $340,000 to Mr.
Boehner's political campaigns, with Mr. Gates being the top individual donor among the thousands during Mr. Boehner's
political career, according to a tally by the Center for Public Integrity.
While many lawmakers in each party have networks of donors, lobbyists and former aides who now represent corporate
interests, Mr. Boehner's ties seem especially deep. His clique even has a nickname on Capitol Hill, Boehner Land. The
members of this inner circle said their association with Mr. Boehner translates into open access to him and his staff.
""He likes to bring similarly minded people together to try to advance legislation or oppose it,"" said Drew Maloney, a
lobbyist at Ogilvy Government Relations. ""That is how you get things done.""
One lobbyist in the club — after lauding each staff member in Mr. Boehner's office that he routinely calls to ask for help —
ticked off the list of recent issues for which he had won the lawmaker's backing: combating fee increases for the oil
industry, fighting a proposed cap on debit card fees, protecting tax breaks for hedge fund executives and opposing a cap
on greenhouse gas emissions.
Still, with Mr. Boehner and his party in the minority, they often lost the fights.
But despite the recent string of defeats on the House floor, Mr. Boehner has benefited from his alliance with lobbyists.
From 2000 to 2007, Mr. Boehner flew at least 45 times, often with his wife, Debbie, on corporate jets provided by
companies including R. J. Reynolds. (As required, Mr. Boehner reimbursed part of the costs.)
In addition, over the last decade, he has taken 41 other trips paid for by corporate sponsors or industry groups, often to
popular golf spots. Those trips make him one of the top House beneficiaries of such travel, which has recently been
curbed as a result of changes in ethics rules in Washington.
Mr. Boehner continues to travel to popular golf destinations on a corporate-subsidized tab, although now it is paid for
through his political action committee, the Freedom Project. In the last 18 months, it has spent at least $67,000 at the Ritz
Carlton Naples in Florida, at least $20,000 at the Robert Trent Jones Golf Club in Gainesville, Va., and at least $29,000 at
the Muirfield Village Golf Club in Dublin, Ohio, federal records show, for fund-raising events.
In June, with the prospects for a Republican takeover of the House rising, Mr. Boehner moved to accelerate his fund-
raising effort, starting what he called the Boehner for Speaker campaign. The idea was to use his high profile to draw
large donations that would be mostly allocated to help elect other House Republicans.
He turned again to the same group of lobbyists, former aides and friends during a July meeting at the headquarters of the
Republican National Committee.
""The wave is there, there is a rebellion in the country, and we have good candidates,"" Mr. Boehner told his supporters,
one of the lobbyists present at the meeting recalled. ""But I don't want to miss this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity because
we have not raised enough money. They might be able to stop us with a wall of money.""
Mr. Calio of Citigroup was among the first to write a large check. So far, a party spokesman said, the campaign has raised
nearly $2 million. Mr. Boehner has helped raise millions more in the last six weeks for Republican House candidates
across the country and the party, appearing at more than 40 fund-raisers.
The Boehner for Speaker campaign offers donors who give the maximum amount special perks, like ""meetings with
Leader Boehner and much much more.""
But his lobbyist friends and former aides said these incentives did not mean too much, because they already had plenty of
access to Mr. Boehner. They just now want to see him as the speaker of the House.
""He knows this is going to be a tough election,"" said Samuel J. Baptista, a friend, golf partner and lobbyist whose clients
include Goldman Sachs and Discover Financial. ""But people who underestimate him really do so at their own peril.""","UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05772323 Date: 08/31/2015

G.O.P. Leader Is Tightly Bound to Lobbyists
By ERIC LIPTON
WASHINGTON — House Democrats were preparing late last year for the first floor vote on the financial regulatory
overhaul when Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio and other Republican leaders summoned more than 100 industry
lobbyists to Capitol Hill for a private strategy session.
The bill's passage in the House already seemed inevitable. But Mr. Boehner and his deputies told the Wall Street
lobbyists and trade association leaders that by teaming up, they could still perhaps block its final passage or at least water
it down.
""We need you to get out there and speak up against this,"" Mr. Boehner said that December afternoon, according to three
people familiar with his remarks, while also warning against cutting side deals with Democrats.
That sort of alliance — they won a few skirmishes, though they lost the war on the regulatory bill — is business as usual
for Mr. Boehner, the House minority leader and would-be speaker if Republicans win the House in November. He
maintains especially tight ties with a circle of lobbyists and former aides representing some of the nation's biggest
businesses, including Goldman Sachs, Google, Citigroup, R. J. Reynolds, MillerCoors and UPS.
They have contributed hundreds of thousands of dollars to his campaigns over the years, provided him rides on their
corporate jets, socialized with him at luxury golf resorts and waterfront bashes and are now leading fund-raising efforts for
his Boehner for Speaker campaign, which is soliciting checks of up to $37,800 each, the maximum allowed.
Some of the lobbyists readily acknowledge routinely seeking his office's help — calling the congressman and his aides as
often as several times a week — to advance their agenda in Washington. And in many cases, Mr. Boehner has helped
